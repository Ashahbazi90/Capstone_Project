    &gt; In some instances, you might be able to view them on past comments, but they can't be used on comments moving forward.

In related news, Reddit Collectible Avatar (RCA) NFTs have a new community manager but also made r/CollectibleAvatars restricted. The new CM does stay Reddit is seeking new ways you can grow Reddit NFTs with partners, however.

It’s worth noting, previous Reddit 10-Q does disclose Reddit is indeed continuing Reddit NFT development and seeking further opportunities, which obviously would violate SEC Rule 10b-5 if untrue. However, the largest portion of language related to RCA NFTs is about the regulatory risk and uncertainty that NFTs have. Moreover, both revenue and expenses from RCA NFTs was specified to be immaterial. 

So while technically speaking it appears Reddit NFT avatars are still being supported and opportunities officially explored, it appears to be at the bare minimum.

And similar to sub-reddit cryptocurrencies, it appears yet another blockchain related ecosystem feature is being sunset. 

This may or may not be pessimistic, however, as on one hand another ecosystem feature being removed seems negative, but on the other hand, they genuinely do not seem popular and many people seem to think they’re annoying. ",0.79,31,0,31,CryptoCurrency,2024-07-17 19:05:06

A while back, I won't say how long, we were in talks with a company that was going to enable us to allow the userbase that we had to buy and sell crypto through our application. The company in question had invested money in FTX, lost it all, and then proceeded to restructure their company internally and withdraw from talks with the application I work for for a business deal. We did what we had to do to survive, and other employees were let go before me, much longer in advance, but it's finally become my turn to hand in the badge.               

I am not 100% jobless, I'm not desperate for cash, I personally did not lose money, and I am not here to ask for your sympathy. I am just here to point out how one man that was beyond dumb is having effects on people - even years after the fact.                 

I do have another job in bitcoin mining. I have debts, but I can use my crypto savings to deal with them, although I will be reluctant to part with them. Financially, I am above water. That's what matters most.

,t3 _ 1e4znej,CryptoCurrency,Why BTC will keep going up as long as people keep predicting a crash ,"The last time BTC had an exponential move to the upside was during the last election year. This is partially because the halvening cycle and the election cycle are currently in sync every 4 years, but there’s further reasons as to why we’ll likely see much higher prices sooner rather than later. 

1.) We’ve obviously been in a 5 month range. Usually, a long time of price consolidation, results in a massive move. Any move above the 70ks will be swift and large 

2.) The ETH ETF approval is coming up thus further legitimizing crypto in general and allowing for even more people to easily invest 

3.) Given the largely negative sentiment merely two weeks ago, there are still tons of shorts trapped. The funding rates for most derivative contracts on BTC are still very low indicating that the overall futures market is not very bullish yet despite a 10% move. This almost always indicates further upside 

4.) Most of the chatter online is expecting a long boring summer and fall. BTC loves to go up after long periods of boredom and when people least expect it

But last, and most importantly, just look around you even on this sub. You’ll see comments along the lines of:

“Sounds like you’re coping and bought the top”
“Let’s be real this is going back to the 40ks”
“BTC is a dead asset”
“If you seriously think 60+k is a good price to buy BTC, you’re deluded” 

Most of this sub was calling for 40ks just two weeks ago. See you in the 80s.

,t3 _ 1e5rwx2,CryptoCurrency,The btc network value indicator (nvt) indicator is super useful to gauge market trend (shows you quite accurately if the market is undervalued),"Hi r cryptocurrency,

I've been using onchain metrics for quite a while and one metric that has been incredibly useful is the NVT golden cross. It's a variation of the nvt ratio.

The NVT Golden Cross is an on-chain indicator that measures Bitcoin's activity to give a fundamental view of its valuation.

Back in January 2024, this indicator gave a signal at -2.77, suggesting Bitcoin was undervalued. What happened next? Bitcoin surged by 85% to hit $70k. I think that quite impressive. 

Last week when BTC was $55k the nvt ratio reached extreme levels of -3.6 which marked the local bottom. Before someone says in hindsight it's easy to say. I actually shared that info when it happened in my newsletter and on twitter. Here's [the post](https://onchainedge.beehiiv.com/p/bitcoin-nvt-golden-cross). The NVT ratio is very similar to the PE ratio for companies. I also wrote a [thread](https://x.com/onchain_edge/status/1812955543474213258) about it two days ago.

Fast forward to now, the NVT Golden Cross is at -2.19. It starts to become overheated above 2. You can actually look at the [NVT GC on cryptoquant](https://cryptoquant.com/asset/btc/chart/network-indicator/nvt-golden-cross?window=DAY&amp;sma=0&amp;ema=0&amp;priceScale=log&amp;metricScale=linear&amp;chartStyle=line). (It's free and I'm not affiliated with it.)


So, how can you use the NVT Golden Cross in your trading? It's pretty straightforward. 

When the value is above 2.2, Bitcoin is likely overpriced, signaling a potential sell opportunity. 
when it's below -2, Bitcoin is undervalued, indicating a buying opportunity.

You can read more about the nvt golden cross in this [article](https://onchainedge.beehiiv.com/p/bitcoin-nvt-golden-cross) from last week.

,t3 _ 1e5rmos,CryptoCurrency,Ripple (XRP) is a different animal compared to other cryptos,"Since XRP is quite old by today's standards, many people believe and trade it like any other crypto. But XRP has a complete different approach to the technology and should be therefore also treated differently.

Ripple is not only a chain, but has a for profit corporation behind it. Its business model is based on fiat to fiat money transfer with XRP as an intermediate token. For this to properly work the price of the coin is irrelevant, but its liquidity is important. To achieve this, the Ripple Corporation can mint and burn XRP on it own as they seem fit.

People buying just the token are just getting the excess the corporation does not use anymore. On the other hand, the Ripple Corporation is directly funded through these sales. But once they are sold, they have no value to the business model. They don't need to buy some for liquidity, they can just mint some more. To be more clear, by buying XRP one does not participate in the success of Ripple just funding their operations. Quite some one sided business.

To answer some obvious questions: the time frame for the fiat to fiat transfer is short enough, so that price changes for XRP are irrelevant. Blockchain technology is used for having a ledger that holds all transactions in a simple and seamless way. It is also obvious that the corporation has no interest in decentralization or development of its chain technology. Naturaly, its business model creates some serious volume on the chain which may make it look like being ""legit"".

If do not want to fund this corporation without benefits, then you probably don't want to trade XRP.",1.0,1,0,1,CryptoCurrency,2024-07-17 19:54:31
,t3 _ 1e5by0p,CryptoCurrency,Need to send proof of funds (in crypto) to potential customer. What are the risks?,"Hi everyone,

We have a manufacturing business and recently we got contacted by a potential customer.  
As the company is an international company, they work with a middleman (they are the ones that contacted me) and earn a commission on the deal.

I've met with the middleman this weekend and they want to continue with this deal. They will arrange a payment up front by the end customer and after receiving the money on our bankaccount, only then the commission is paid.

They only asked us to pay the commission in any crypto (of any choice) and to send proof that there are funds available in crypto. So we have to put their commission in any form of crypto (could even be USDT) on any wallet (binance, coinbase, kraken, ...) and send them the proof. They want this because they have had troubles in the past that if the company still has to make a business account, put the funds on it, ... it sometimes takes too long.

What are the risks if I would do that and send them some kind of proof that we have funds (for example USDT) on Coinbase. What could they potentially do that would be a risk for us?

Thank you for your advice :)

I then went to bitnob which was fine at first signed up and deposited 30 usd to issue a card and I used it to make payments and purchases (usually when I set up platforms like these I deposit just a small amount, I am going to use so I only have a couple dollars all the time nothing much) due to this when I signed up I was lazy to set up 2fa (I know big mistake, lesson learned). Today I got a notification that my account was charged for Netflix which is my transaction subscription renews today. Shortly after I got a notification of a declined transaction for THUNES DROP and a gift card website, I immediately knew someone was trying to steal money so I deleted the card and withdrew the funds. Initially I assumed my card details got leaked but I have only used it in Netflix and Google wallet so I was confused, anyways I create a new card and deposit the money I withdrew from the old card into the new one. And I go back to doing what I was doing. Then I get a notification from the app that the money I put in the card was withdrawn to the app (so it's available for direct withdrawal) when this happened I immediately knew it wasn't my card details that were compromised but the bitnob account. So I started trying to change my password but it won't change then the attacker changed my email to a temporary email so I couldn't login, so I used my username (luckily I remembered it) and logged in then I saw the money hasn't been withdrawn yet, I couldn't withdraw it bc I have to add a wallet address and to do that an otp is sent to your email in this case the attackers email. So after talking to support to freeze my account (which they didn't do in time) the attacker withdrew all the money to an external address. Here is where things get interesting I blamed myself for not setting up proper 2fa and luckily 17 usd isn't gonna do much damage to me so I was about to take the L and forget about it but then I tried to change my email and I CAN'T, asked someone I know who uses bitnob to try and change their email and they can't as well (their account hasn't been hacked or anything) so how TF did the attacker change the email if users can't change the email. So I checked the attackers wallet address on tronscan and see it has multiple transactions including mine coming from bitnobs address. So could this be an inside job? I blamed the 2fa at first but this looks crazy sus here is the address

Bitcoin price is in the mid-$60k range, and has been hovering there for past few months give or take. The post-halving supply crunch is yet to hit, and now Bitcoin (and crypto in general) has renewed vigor with Trump’s re-election becoming more and more certain. 

Both Trump and his new VP pick JD are bitcoiners. They both also favor a weaker US dollar as pointed out by the NY Times recently. Trump is speaking at next week’s Bitcoin conference. 

Bitcoin ETFs are running strong several months after launching. Gold is also doing well. Fed will begin interest rate cuts, especially with Trump poised to take over again - he favors lower rates and/or money printing to weaken the dollar. 

All this is likely to propel a bull market in BTC next year and beyond. So, my question is about how much bitcoin do you think is enough to materially benefit from the coming boom?

Personally, I have been steadily buying bitcoin since 2021, and am now at just over 3 BTC, which represents about 4% of my net worth. I think this positions me well if there is a big boom in BTC, while not being over-exposed in case things go south.",0.32,0,0,0,CryptoCurrency,2024-07-17 13:52:22

,t3 _ 1e3xrc0,CryptoCurrency,Transforming Freight Factoring with Blockchain: A New Solution for Truckers,"Hi everyone,

I’ve been a longtime lurker here and have had my share of shitcoins and altcoins that I’ve followed and tried to talk about in the past (all of which are now cringeworthy looking back at it). But I’ve taken it upon myself (along with a few others I’ve met in this space) to tie what I have a passion for (blockchain) to the field I work in real life (logistics/finance).

We are starting a business that will utilize blockchain technology to ameliorate the freight factoring service currently offered and used by a large portion of owner-operator and small trucking businesses in the United States. I will say that there is **NO tokenized asset** or any altcoin or shitcoin that we have created for this venture. This is a freight factoring business incorporated in the United States that **USES** blockchain technology in the backend, and the only asset that is involved within this process is USDC stablecoin. We have put this together in a way that truly promotes the use of blockchain and the advantages it can provide to real-world assets.



**A Background to Freight Factoring:**

Freight factoring, for those that do not know, is the process in which receivables are purchased in exchange for immediate funding. So imagine yourself a trucker that owns your own truck, and you move a shipment from point A to point B for a broker. Once completed, you would bill the broker and they would pay you based on NET30 day terms. But for many truckers, cash flow is tight and you need funds sooner, so you sell that receivable to a freight factoring provider who provides you with immediate cash for a fee based on that invoice value. The trucker receives quick funding, the broker pays the invoice as usual, and the factoring company makes some profit – everyone is happy in a perfect world.



**The World is Not Perfect for Truckers – The Current Issues:**

These services are usually not as straightforward as they seem, as truckers usually face issues of hidden fees, complex binding contracts, and delayed funding from providers. All this after truckers think that the advertised factoring rate is all they will endure.

Picture this: how often do you turn on the TV and come across a commercial for a brand-new car showing off all it has to offer? You’re told of this amazing monthly rate which catches your eye as a consumer – ignoring the essay of words that flash by on the bottom of the screen in text so small even pausing couldn’t help you read it. Then once you walk into the dealership, you soon find out that the rate does not include a cash down payment, nor does it include the higher-end model shown in the commercial. Then you have to apply taxes as well as the standard lease rate based on your term. Everything becomes an added cost down to the $5.99 air freshener which, if you’re lucky, they will throw in free of charge to make you feel better. Before you know it, you signed onto an 84-month finance plan for a car that’s twice the price advertised on TV.

This is exactly how the current market of freight factoring businesses operates. Some may promise and certify no added fees or quick payment terms, but there is ALWAYS a catch for many who use the service, especially those who need it most.



**How Our Blockchain Solution Solves This:**

Our platform offers a transparent and fixed rate structure with no hidden fees and provides a no-contract, no-recourse solution. Thanks to blockchain technology, truckers can receive immediate funding at any time, with all transactions recorded on a distributed ledger, guaranteeing full transparency and accountability – something most factoring companies keep secret. A factoring company can advise that THEY don’t charge additional fees and can process same-day payments, but that does not mean your bank will, and this is where blockchain will save truckers both dollars and time.

As mentioned before, we will perform all this using USDC stablecoin, which provides a stable and liquid option for truckers, similar to USD, effectively eliminating the volatility associated with other cryptocurrencies.

[Our Mobile Application](https://preview.redd.it/dzmhd3vtbpcd1.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6364b63c0fc2a36e60947324d28343831bfcaff1)

**Why We Are Excited:**

We believe that we are on the cusp of introducing something special to the market that truly benefits the front-end users of a crucial RWA for the economy within the United States. We are not forcing them to buy into anything, we are not forcing them to learn about crypto and blockchain – the benefits of blockchain are all in the backend. The successful implementation of what we are bringing forth can put a positive light on blockchain technologies and their RWA capabilities. There are no dogs, cats, or monkeys with hats; it is the beneficial aspects of the technology to help ameliorate a process that has been the same for decades with providers that cage their front-end users with fees, terms, and contracts that actually hurt the front-end user.



**Why Post All This Here on Reddit?**

As I said at the beginning, I've been a longtime lurker here and without trying to shill the product (I mean we don’t even have a tokenized asset to shill), I felt like I finally have something worthy of talking about here that truly promotes the use of what we all have such a big passion for. And for those wondering about this whole concept and may have reservations on it, we have been conducting research for over a year on the industry, the front-end users, the feasibility of our solution, and long-term financial projections. We have core team members who work directly with truckers who actually endure the hardships of current factoring providers and already have several who are willing to participate in our pilot program launching later this year. Our MVP is just about completed and we look forward to actually putting this into motion and seeing the fruits of our labor help put blockchain in a positive light.",0.83,50,0,50,CryptoCurrency,2024-07-15 15:33:47

I need some advice. My boss insists that posting on Reddit is a great way to promote our company on a minimal budget. However, I'm struggling with one major challenge: how do we effectively compete against the meme coins and shitcoins that constantly spam and use bots to drive engagement?

We're looking to build genuine, organic engagement and create a positive presence here. But it feels like the meme coin posts with their flashy promises and sensational claims drown out more serious projects.

Has anyone here successfully navigated this landscape? How do you cut through the noise and get real users to notice and engage with your posts? Any strategies, tips, or insights would be greatly appreciated!

,t3 _ 1e43j4j,CryptoCurrency,OpenAlias v2 Discussion: Help OpenAlias with a New and Improved Username Specification,"Some of you may be familiar with [OpenAlias](https://openalias.org), a username address specification that is widely implemented in Monero wallets and also in some Bitcoin wallets like Electrum. It relies on DNS TXT records.

If you're not familiar with OpenAlias, please [read this first](https://medium.com/@JEhrenhofer/openalias-the-best-cryptocurrency-wallet-feature-youve-never-heard-of-bbf4a991d0a8).

OpenAlias v1 (the current design) has existed since 2014-2015, and it has worked wonderfully at what it set out to do. However, it was not designed for assets to exist on multiple chains, and it lacks some modern features that people may wish to use.

Thus, I have started a discussion for an OpenAlias v2 specification. The primary goals for OAv2 are the following:

1. Retain the advantages of OpenAlias v1.
2. Remain asset/blockchain agnostic.
3. Avoid conflicting with other standards, such as ENS and BIP-353.
4. Better support assets existing on multiple blockchains and L2s, such as USDT existing on Ethereum, Polygon, Tron, etc.
5. Support additional optional metadata features.

You can read and comment on the full discussion and the suggested v2 specification here: https://github.com/openalias/openalias-spec/pull/1

So I recently broke my iphone and upon getting my new one, realized I never wrote down my recovery phrase for my Coinbase wallet. I have about $10k worth of crypto in it (yes, I know l'm an idiot please spare me the ridicule lol)
Anyways, when trying to sign back in I see the option for iCloud recovery phrase backup! It then gives me two different recovery phrases it has ""found""

I have tried so many of my passwords and nothing is working, but I am deciding whether or not to give up based on this one thing...

Based on the picture I have attached, do the two recovery phrases found mean that I did indeed back them up on iCloud? The dates underneath each wallet address would insinuate that's the date the accounts were backed up— is this true and accurate?

If this screenshot is essentially PROVING to me that I did indeed back up my recovery phrase through iCloud, then I have some hope and can dig into things with apple and figure out WHERE that password is stored in iCloud so that I can gain access to my recovery phrase.

If this is not proof I backed up my recovery phrase to iCloud, I will give up and move on.
Any and all suggestions, feedback would be gre appreciated!

Hackers are grabbing encrypted data now, knowing that future quantum computers will easily decrypt it. Big players like Apple and PayPal are already taking steps to protect against this threat.

We've seen hints of this danger before—data from Google and Amazon rerouted through Russia, for instance. These breaches often go unnoticed until quantum computers make the data readable.

Quantum computers can break today's encryption, posing a huge risk to blockchain security.

One project I found during my research is the Abelian Foundation, which is developing a quantum-resistant blockchain with a unique Layer 2 application for enhanced security. Abelian claims to integrate top-tier security with NIST-standard cryptography and supports a secure mining community, enabling users to future-proof their crypto investments against emerging quantum threats.

,t3 _ 1e4rtq5,CryptoMarkets,Can ASI token merge redefine crypto AI landscape?,"Investors are excited about upcoming merger of three AI superheroes - Fetch.ai, Ocean Protocol and SingularityNET - which is creating a lot of buzz in crypto lately. This token merge aims to introduce ASI (Artificial Superintelligence) token, potentially reshaping the landscape of AI narrative in crypto. With the countdown underway, investors are also speculating whether this alliance could ignite broader surge of AI-related tokens.

The merge process started on July 1st. With the Phase 1 (OCEAN and AGIX merge to FET) approaching the end, holders are preparing for the Phase 2 and the final transition to ASI. The ultimate goal is to establish a cohesive ecosystem valued at $7.5B, potentially positioning ASI among the top 20 cryptocurrencies out there.

Here are the conversion rates for each token:  
  
1 OCEAN = 0.433226 ASI  
1 AGIX = 0.43335 ASI  
1 FET = 1 ASI

The important thing to point out is that these conversion rates are all fixed and won't change under any circumstances. Most CEXs will handle the swap automatically but those who hold on self-custody wallets will need to migrate their tokens manually with tools provided.

ASI isn't merly a typical cryptocurrency. They are aming to be the versatile toolset of the AI blockchain real. You can think of it as a Swiss Army Knife of the crypto AI market. The token will serve as the backbone of a decentralized AI network, enabling users to utilize and contribute to AI services independently of major tech corporations.

Imagine it as a public library of AI resources, accessible for borrowing and contribution by anyone interested.

This token merge has the potential to disrupt the status quo in several ways but primarily, it could emerge as the preferred platform for businesses seeking AI solutions without getting locked into corporate ecosystems.

Some areas where AI still requires significant transformations include addressing biases and fairness, and improving transparency and security. This is where I believe SightAI can make a difference, but let's leave that aside for now.



We shouldn't overlook the importance of the safety and robustness of AI systems, as well as consistent advancements in ensuring ethical and responsible data practices. Above all, data scalability remains a crucial challenge.



Regarding SightAI itself and its transformative impact on the AI space, the company's commitment to secure AI computations and ensuring sensitive data's privacy and integrity is particularly noteworthy.



We are already seeing SightAI partnering with other projects, even before its full launch. This speaks volumes in regard to its potential and the future of AI, which seems to extend beyond our current capabilities.

It’s only $30, but it’s a good learning lesson for anyone out there who is also learning about crypto and how transferring works.  Just a heads-up, I’m super new to this, and there’s a lot to learn—like bridging, staking, mining, and NFTs. Honestly, I don’t even fully understand half of those things I just mentioned. I’m not even close to being a pro, but I missed the whole concept of network compatibility, gas costs, fees, and more.  It’s definitely a paid lesson and it sucuuks, but learning costs money.

* Going for altcoins with higher liquidity and market cap reduces your risk
* Altcoins with high market cap already have a good adoption which can lead to their growth as the industry in whole increases.
* If they grow, then they tend to give higher returns than the crypto heavyweights.

These protocols aim to enhance the utility and security of existing staking mechanisms, allowing users to maximize their staking rewards and contribute to multiple networks simultaneously. Here’s a breakdown of what restaking protocols are and a list of some prominent ones you could even know about.



- What Exactly Are Restaking Protocols?



Restaking protocols enable stakers to reuse their staked assets across multiple networks or protocols, effectively multiplying their rewards without needing additional capital. This innovation helps to enhance the security of various networks and provides stakers with greater earning potential.



- Benefits of Restaking Protocols:



- Maximized Rewards: Increase your staking returns by participating in multiple networks.

- Enhanced Security: Contribute to the security of more than one network.

- Capital Efficiency: Utilize your staked assets more effectively without needing extra funds.



- Some Restaking Protocols:



1. EtherFi: The largest restaking protocol boasting a TVL of over $2.8 billion. It enhances security across multiple networks and protocol by letting its users stake ETH to receive eETH.



2. EigenLayer: Currently boasts of a TVL of around $1.5billion. It is also built on the Ethereum blockchain! Provides option for Ethereum stakers to extend their staked ETH or LSTs beyond the Ethereum network. Added security and even more rewards!



3. Pendle: Focused on the tokenization and trading of yield bearing assets which can be traded independently. This offers a lot of flexibility for its users. It is an innovative protocol in the DeFi space.



  
4. Puffer Finance: A liquid restaking protocol capitalizing on the EigenLayer Framework and frenzy. It is operating on the default module focusing on PoS validation without thoroughly engaging in restaking. Further long term modifications are expected. It currently has a TVL of over $850 million. 



3. Picasso: This is a cross-chain interoperability and restaking platform operating on the Solana network, enabling users to stake and restake their assets across different blockchains.



Restaking protocols are an exciting development in the blockchain ecosystem, offering stakers new ways to maximize their returns and contribute to network security. By understanding and utilizing these protocols, you can enhance your staking strategy and take full advantage of the evolving DeFi landscape.

I recently came across a new platform called Spinofwealth and wanted to see if anyone here has any experience with it. The concept behind it seems pretty intriguing – it's a community-driven lottery platform where project owners can create and share their own lottery-style projects. Participants can commit to these projects, and then a spin determines nine lucky winners who take 90% of the pot, with the remaining 10% going to the project owner.

What caught my attention is how it seems to integrate social elements with a gamified approach to lotteries. I'm curious about how it handles transparency and fairness, and if there are any notable success stories or tips for getting started.

Has anyone here used Spinofwealth? What are your thoughts on its potential for community engagement and its overall user experience? Are there any similar platforms that you would recommend for someone interested in this type of community project?

Let's dive into Web3 privacy—it's crucial but complex. Here’s a breakdown:

**Levels of Privacy in Web3:**

1. **Network-level Privacy:**
   * Ensured through blockchain's consensus mechanisms.
   * Example: Bitcoin’s pseudonymous transactions.
2. **Protocol-level Privacy:**
   * Built on existing blockchains via privacy protocols.
   * Example: Ethereum's smart contracts enhancing transaction privacy.
3. **User-level Privacy:**
   * Focuses on protecting individual data.
   * Implemented through stealth wallets or decentralized identity (DID).

**Challenges in Web3 Privacy:**

* **Decentralized Data Compliance:**
   * Difficulties in privacy regulations like notice, choice, and data destruction due to decentralized nature.
* **Privacy by Design:**
   * Integrating privacy features into Web3 systems from the outset.
   * Includes robust encryption and anonymization techniques.
* **Smart Contracts and Data Security:**
   * Ensuring secure handling of private data within smart contracts.
   * Utilizing techniques like zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) for confidentiality.

**Solutions and Innovations:**

* **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs):**
   * Allows proving statements without revealing sensitive data.
   * Enhances transaction privacy and identity verification.
* **Oasis and Smart Privacy:**
   * Utilizes Oasis’ confidential EVM, Sapphire, for confidential smart contracts.
   * Integrates TEEs and ZKPs for robust data privacy.

**Ensuring Transparency:**

* **Regulatory Compliance:**
   * Adherence to GDPR and global privacy standards.
   * Implementing transparent data management and consent mechanisms.

**Conclusion:** Web3 privacy combines innovation with compliance challenges. Technologies like ZKPs and confidential EVMs play a vital role. Balancing transparency and privacy is key for a trusted transition to Web3.

It all started with the release of **[Satoshi Nakamoto's whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)** however that will probably go over the head of most readers so we recommend the following articles/books/videos as a good starting point for understanding how Bitcoin works and a little about its long term potential:

* [Article: The Bullish Case for Bitcoin](https://medium.com/@vijayboyapati/the-bullish-case-for-bitcoin-6ecc8bdecc1)
* [Book: The Bitcoin Standard](https://www.amazon.com/Bitcoin-Standard-Decentralized-Alternative-Central/dp/1119473861) - or [download a free copy here](https://z-epub.com/book/the-bitcoin-standard-epub-download)

You can also see the number of times Bitcoin was [declared dead by the media](https://99bitcoins.com/obituary-stats) (LOL!)

## Key properties of Bitcoin

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be a [maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoins created](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/10h04a6/this_is_how_we_know_theres_only_21_million_bitcoin/) and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the [inflation schedule](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The [halving countdown](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/) tells you approximately how much time until the next block reward halving.
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read and contribute to the [source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) yourself.
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://getumbrel.com/).  
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the Bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in Bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.earn.com/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can’t be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin. 
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the Lightning Network to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. 
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](http://i.imgur.com/wkTyyaV.png) better than gold or fiat.
* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).
* **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/) and [mempool activity](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/), an open source second layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network enables Bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin with fees so low that they are negligible.
* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.

## Where can I buy bitcoin?

[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/buy) and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular places to buy bitcoin are listed below.

* [Strike](https://strike.me/)
* [Cash App](https://cash.app/)
* [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/)
* [River Financial](https://river.com/)
* [Bull Bitcoin](https://www.bullbitcoin.com/) 
* [Bitcoin Well](https://bitcoinwell.com/) 
* [Relai](https://relai.app/)
* [LibertyX](https://libertyx.com/)
* [CoinCorner](https://www.coincorner.com/)
* [RoboSats](https://learn.robosats.com/) (P2P)
* [Bisq](https://bisq.network/) (decentralized &amp; P2P)
* [HodlHodl](https://hodlhodl.com/?filters%5Bcurrency_code%5D=USD) (P2P)
* [List of peer-to-peer exchanges](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/)
* [Debifi](https://debifi.com/) (non-custodial lending)

You can also purchase in cash with [local ATMs](http://coinatmradar.com/). Services such as [CardCoins](https://www.cardcoins.co/) let you purchase bitcoin with prepaid gift cards. If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin use [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  

**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https://cryptowat.ch/bitstamp/btcusd) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. 

## Securing your bitcoin

With Bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold your bitcoin for you.

* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn best computer security practices, then a hardware wallet such as a [BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/),  [Trezor](https://www.trezor.io/), [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/), or [Blockstream Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade/) is recommended. You can even build your own open source hardware wallet called a [SeedSigner](https://seedsigner.com/).

* If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) options to choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.  Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.  Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.

* If you prefer to work with third party **""Bitcoin banks""** to set up a collaborative custody arrangement, try [Unchained Capital](https://unchained-capital.com/) but be aware that any third party you use exposes you to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **""Not your keys, not your coins""**. 

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.

**Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.**  Hackers have been using a technique called ""SIM swapping"" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.

Google Auth | Authy | OTP Auth | andOTP
--------------|--------|------------|--------
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&amp;hl=en) | N/A | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp)
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384) | N/A

Physical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups. See [Yubikey](https://yubikey.com/) or [Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) to purchase security keys.

Both Coinbase and Gemini support physical security keys. 


## Watch out for scams

As mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the r / btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **""Don't trust, verify""**. 

* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.
* Ignore private messages offering services.
* **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website.
* **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.**  Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste.
* Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [https://www.google.com/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME), without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to.  Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address.  It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money.

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoin can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](https://foldingathome.org/?lng=en).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read the [mining FAQ](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. 

If you want to contribute to the Bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions there are many [great resources](https://raspibolt.org/) you can use to [run a full node](https://river.com/learn/how-to-run-a-bitcoin-node/).  You can view the global distribution of reachable Bitcoin nodes on [this webpage.](https://bitnodes.io/nodes/all/#global-bitcoin-nodes)

## Bitcoin Units

One bitcoin is worth quite a lot (thousands of £/$/€), so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
bitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | used as default unit in Electrum wallet
bit | μBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin
satoshi | sat | 100,000,000 per bitcoin | smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $10,000 for one bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.001 BTC
* 1 mBTC
* 1,000 bits
* 100,000 sats

For more information check out the [bitcoin units wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/bitcoin_units).

Fink sees it as digital gold and protection against government control/ money printing. Obviously he has stake in promoting, but understand that the big risk is his reputation. It take guts to say you understand it and it's legit. Most big players are not there yet.
* Jamie Dimon is rumored to have had a ""change pf heart"". This will be fun to watch play out!
* Trump was against it and now is speaking at the BTC conference. Yes, you can say its for votes, and it is, but for a presidential candidate to publicly support it... I don't think people understand how major that is. Its a huge risk and he sees more positives than negatives. Imagine someone supporting BTC in 2012 or even 2016 elections. They would lose more votes than gain votes.

In general, people only flip to being pro-Bitcoin from being anti-bitcoin (or not having an opinion at all), and rarely the other way around. You just don't see people who **truly understand Bitcoin** flipping, and then publicly denouncing it. 

Once you get it, there really is no going back.

We are going to get to watch A LOT of high profile people flip to understanding Bitcoin and realizing the economic force of nature that it is.

,t3 _ 1e5r8ay,Bitcoin,How do you keep yourself objective?,"I don't think I have to lecture you guys about the inflationary nature of fiat, the perils of our current global political climate, the importance of imparcialty through decentralization, blah blah blah. If you inform yourself, you'll make the best decision for you... but that doesn't exactly work for existencial fears about an unpredictable future.

My personal opinion is that bitcoin will keep going up forever, which is why I wanna dump all my money into it as soon as possible to catch the (maybe) cheapest price now compared to years into the future. But there's a non-zero chance I'm wrong. Also, I went back to school, that's happening right now, and in the short term, even though I'd love to use the current bull run to DCA out just enough to not need a job and focus only on my studies (I don't have much, but I'm very frugal), what happens when like last month, the damn thing goes down and I gotta pay rent?

Usually the answer would be to have an emergency fund, or to quit bitching and get a job, or just not buying in the first place and focusing on getting through school, and many other very valid opinions. I guess for me it's a matter of conviction. I've learnt about this stuff for a long while, I'm convinced is going up forever (over the very long term, that is), and I wanna buy right now instead of later because of the next US election (and this year in general tbh, with the ETF, halving and more) and its economical impact. Republican or democrat, we all know this one is a big one...

But I can be wrong, I know I can be very wrong, and if I am, I'll lose it all... but if I'm right, I won't have to get a job during school, and school itself NEEDS to work, even more than BTC going up really. I just wanna be a good student and focus on my shit goddamnit I don't wanna work right now 😭

Anyway, blabber over. My question is: how do you avoid doing stupid, impulsive things out of an exurbance of faith? How do you keep yourself objective, in good times and bad?",0.73,7,0,7,Bitcoin,2024-07-17 19:37:57
,t3 _ 1e60cgh,Bitcoin,Running own node = more anonymous?,"Hello,

In many posts I can see the argument that running your own node can help being more anonymous, for example this post [https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1cdow4i/dear\_bitcoiners\_start\_running\_your\_own\_bitcoin/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1cdow4i/dear_bitcoiners_start_running_your_own_bitcoin/)

&gt;do you want anybody to realize the same IP keeps looking up the balance of the same address with that kind of balance?

I understand that, but I'm curious about another aspect. It is recommended to open port 8333 to truly participate in the network stability. 

Doesn't that mean that anyone will be able to see that my IP is hosting a bitcoin node? Essentially it doesn't say that I am a bitcoiner but if we are realistic, how many people have a bitcoin node and are NOT interested in bitcoin?

There must be ways to hide somehow my IP or location, but does that require separate work/configuration, or is this integrated in the main tools available such as Umbrel or Start9?

Sadly my Father passed away on June 25 and left me and my mother in some significant debt (she doesn't work and im only 20 years old working a shitty job while im in school).

I know my father was big into crypto. While scavenging through his paperwork to get some documents prepared for the lawyer I found his 12 word phrase written down and shoved in between two random folders. He used to talk to me about cold wallets and things like that but I never really understood what the hell he was talking about. After doing some research im assuming he had his crypto in a cold wallet, but im not sure where to go from here. I created a coinbase account and imported the wallet (learned this from a youtube video that another redditor suggested) but the funds do not match what he would always show me when he was alive. 

Not sure what to do. Any finances that we could recover would be extremely helpful. Or any suggestions.

Anyway, the three words were Defense Production Act.

If Bitcoin is declared a national security asset (which a President can do) the government could:  
1) prioritize mining hardware production.   
2) mandate that companies prioritize domestic sourcing of components, strengthening the supply chain.Intel has an ASIC chip.  The government could move to have them produce as many as possible and buy all production.    
3) direct energy production and allocation for mining  
4) encourage further R&amp;D in the bitcoin space

To clarify the above, the government of China bans anything they cannot control. Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Netflix - whatever they cannot control. However, discussing the existence of these platforms is just fine.

,t3 _ 1e4v5ib,Bitcoin,Muun vs. Aqua - thinking through the benefit of Lightning/Liquid,"I have been testing Muun vs. Aqua (and also Green) and it seems that Muun is actually cheaper becasue it saves steps/fees. Am I’m processing this accurately?  
  
Right now Lightning/Liquid options are providing some cheaper ways to move from an Exchange to Cold Storage, right? (especially for those of us that illogically can’t get River or Strike to verify us 😑) If it’s free to send by Lightning (i.e. Kraken) then Muun receives that for free and has only one step/fee to send on chain to a cold wallet. In my test the total Muun fees were 1.6%  
  
But Aqua charges a small fee to receive Lightning (like .35%), then you pay a  bigger fee to swap into your BTC (my test was about 1.75% on 100k sats - which was still cheaper than doing this myself via Boltz), and then you pay a fee to move from the BTC wallet to a cold wallet. In my test total Aqua fees totaled 2.4%

(For Green, their experimental Lightning wallet is currently very glitchy, and it would require a manual swap then via Boltz to covert ot BTC and send to the Jade Hardware Wallet. I couldn’t complete a test, but the manual swap in Boltz is only cheaper than Muun up to 175k sats, for higher amounts the .5% extra Boltz charge makes Muun the cheaper option than Green/Boltz)

What am I missing? According to previous posts that I could find on here Muun is considered more expensive because it’s not a true lightning wallet, but if your goal is staking sats than it’s actually cheaper. 



Additional details I noted:  
  
Muun’s custom BTC Send fee/speed is not quite as low as Aqua allows (maybe that’s where Muun ”bundles” the swap fee?). Muun won’t let you go below some “minimum market speed” (i.e. like 6.5 sats/vbyte) whereas Aqua lets you specify anywhere from 2-5 sats/vbyte. But adding the swap fee in Aqua always makes it more expensive than Muun.   
  
Now if you’re sending/receiving Liquid than Muun isn’t an option. But my test of sending Liquid from Aqua to Green was slightly more expensive than via Lightning (i.e. 140-260 on 10k sats on Liquid vs. 65 sats on Lightning) That might be affected by having “open channels“ already, and when/if there are extra fees on Lightning to do so (I haven’t figures out how to factor in those variables yet).

Also reminder that the next FOMC meeting is in 16 days. I have little doubt these comments today and what comes from this meeting 31 July will strongly indicate rate cuts for September. FedWatch Tool even predicts a 90.3% chance.

Now's the time to pull the trigger if you haven't already instead of sitting at the sidelines. 

##Money Printer Go Brrr

...

&gt;Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Monday that the central bank will not wait until inflation hits 2% to cut interest rates.

&gt;Speaking at the Economic Club of Washington D.C., Powell referenced the idea that central bank policy works with “long and variable lags” to explain why the Fed wouldn’t wait for its target to be hit.

&gt;“The implication of that is that if you wait until inflation gets all the way down to 2%, you’ve probably waited too long, because the tightening that you’re doing, or the level of tightness that you have, is still having effects which will probably drive inflation below 2%,” Powell said.

&gt;Instead, the central bank is looking for “greater confidence” that inflation will return to the 2% level, Powell said.

&gt;“What increases that confidence in that is more good inflation data, and lately here we have been getting some of that,” he said.

&gt;Powell also said that he thinks a “hard landing” for the U.S. economy was not “a likely scenario.”

&gt;Monday was Powell’s first public speaking appearance since the consumer price index report for June showed cooling inflation, with prices actually falling month over month.

&gt;Powell said at the top of his appearance that he was not intending to make any signals about when the Fed might start to cut interest rates. The central bank’s next policy meeting is at the end of July

,t3 _ 1e5xfn5,ethereum,Which blockchain network is best for a fantasy sports betting dApp?,"Hi everyone!

I'm developing a decentralized fantasy sports betting contest, and I'm looking for input on which blockchain network would be the best fit. A key feature is that we need to use a single network to manage our jackpot and carry-over pool, so cross-chain solutions aren't viable for us right now.

Here's a quick rundown of our needs:

* Must be a single network to handle our unified jackpot and carry-over feature
* Low transaction fees (users will be making frequent, potentially small-value transactions)
* Good adoption and user-friendly for mainstream users (for fantasy football and betting players)
* Fast transaction times
* Scalability to handle a growing user base
* Strong security (for handling user funds)

2. Arbitrum
3. Polygon

Layer 2 solutions are made for scalability purposes. By batching and compressing data, they improve the whole Ethereum ecosystem's scalability.

These networks are built by companies (Matter Labs, Offchain Labs, Consensys, OP Labs, etc.) that will eventually and progressively decentralize network operations.

But, as any company needs to make profits, I'm wondering what is their business model to make profits for themselves? 
Validators and Stakers make money for contributing to the network security. But what is the incentives for the company spending millions of $ to build the foundation of these networks?

For the moment, since most of these networks are centralized and operated by the companies' nodes but their part should progressively reduce as they will keep moving into decentralization.

Is their business model focused on next applications they will build on these networks?
Or is it only focused on operating validators?
Or is it just R&amp;D? But I can't imagine investors would bring millions without having an idea of how they will make money out of it.

,t3 _ 1e4u80j,ethereum,Meme Coin Creation: What I Learned,"A few months ago, I thought about how meme coins make huge gains, with the creators making the most money. So I decided to launch my own meme coin.

I chose to create it on the Base network because Solana was having issues at the time. I also considered TON, but there's less money there. Base uses EVM, which means the tools would work on Ethereum or other EVM networks too.

First, I wanted to make sure the token would score 100/100 on checkers. This meant creating a contract where the creator has no control after launch, and locking or burning the liquidity pool (LP) to prevent rug pulls.

I learned that a good meme coin needs a website, Twitter, and Telegram, along with the meme itself and lots of images. After launching the pool, you need to pay to add your logo and links on DexTools and DexScreener.

I decided on a stealth launch instead of a presale. It's common to put 100% of the tokens in the pool at creation, or maybe keep up to 7% for yourself.

How does the developer make money if all tokens are in the pool? They buy back some tokens right after creating the pool, when the price is lowest.

I planned to put all tokens and 0.4 ETH in the pool. If I bought tokens worth 0.4 ETH right after launch, I'd get 50% of all tokens. If I wanted 75%, I'd need to buy 1.2 ETH worth.

The total cost for launching a meme coin, including website creation, pool setup, buying back 50% of tokens, and paying for listings, came to about $5,300.

I learned it's better to spread the tokens across many wallets instead of keeping them in one, as large holdings scare potential buyers. Ideally, no wallet should hold more than 2% of all tokens.

To make everything look good on bubble maps (which show connections between token holders), you need to spread ETH across multiple wallets and buy from each one on Uniswap.

[Bubble Map](https://preview.redd.it/mu8w3algywcd1.png?width=642&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f4fb87181d7fb6042c2efd0aa6dd1473ff9d318c)

For a long-lasting token, you need to create pumps by buying tokens, then dump to take profits, and simulate activity between pumps. Doing this manually is impossible, so you need a market maker. I couldn't afford to hire one, so I decided to write my own market maker bot. I created a wallet generator and a script for initial buyback.

When I launched, sniper bots bought a bunch of tokens in the first minute. I had to cancel that pool and create a new one. On the second try, only two sniper bots bought small amounts. I ran my script to buy tokens from 100 wallets, then burned the LP and paid for listings.

Users came and bought some tokens in the first half-day, but most sold after that, and the token didn't grow further. I improved my bot to do wash trading and create pumps, but I realized that pumps in older tokens don't get noticed. To grow further, I'd need to figure out how to buy effective advertising, which I don't know how to do yet and can't afford.

Basically, it seems you can't just launch a token and make money without investing in advertising.   
I've paused my meme coin experiment for now. I'd be interested in continuing with a partner who has crypto traffic or experience in advertising meme coins.

I won't share the token, but I'm happy to answer other technical questions in the comments. If you're interested in the market maker script or partnership, message me on Telegram: akamitch

,t3 _ 1e4hmkf,ethereum,The State of ZK - Q2 TL;DR,"Hey there! 

What a quarter! Here's a summary of what happened during Q2 in the ZK space (you can read the full report on the link below): 

* ZK Research continued in Q2 with the release of new papers on sum-check protocols, optimizations around small fields and ZK hardware. 

* zkVMs took center stage, with Jolt, SP1, and Risc Zero each releasing updates that pushed the boundaries of verifiable computation.

* This quarter also witnessed the first mainnet launch of a ZK application platform, with Mina’s Berkeley upgrade. Their zkApps environment will make building ZK applications much more accessible to non-ZK-native developers, and we expect other programmable ZK platforms, such as Aleo and Aztec, to launch soon as well. 

* In terms of ZK applications, several new products addressing payments, on-ramps, voting, and ID were announced or released this past quarter.

* On the ZK Supply Chain front, we saw additional teams announce their plans include a prover marketplace in their systems, and a new category of project emerged in this stack — proof verification aggregators.

A month ago, I fell victim to a scam promoted through a YouTube sponsored video about a Uniswap slippage MEV bot. I lost 2000$ unfortunately, after realizing my funds were irretrievable, I started monitoring the scammer's wallet address: 0x46D4cEe5d1531A8045c3084D18B6b3c2f5429560

All transactions from his wallet eventually ended up at this address: [https://etherscan.io/address/0x077D360f11D220E4d5D831430c81C26c9be7C4A4](https://etherscan.io/address/0x077D360f11D220E4d5D831430c81C26c9be7C4A4)

This address seems extremely busy, with thousands of dollars moving through it every minute. Upon doing some research, I discovered that other people who got scammed also reported that their funds end up at this address.

,t3 _ 1e1pfmw,ethereum,How Danksharding (Blobs) will help ZK-Rollups?,"As far as I have learnt, Optimistic Rollups need to post the entire transaction data as CALLDATA or BLOBs to the mainnet to allow other validators to verify the correctness. ([Refer 1](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/optimistic-rollups/#:~:text=As%20mentioned%2C%20optimistic,of%20state%20transitions))

But this is not the case for ZK-Rollups as posting the entire transaction data in mainnet is optional. ([Refer 2](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/zk-rollups/#:~:text=ZK%2Drollups%20can%20compress%20transaction%20data%20better%20than%20optimistic%20rollups%20since%20they%20don%27t%20have%20to%20post%20all%20the%20data%20required%20to%20validate%20each%20transaction.%20They%20only%20have%20to%20post%20the%20minimal%20data%20required%20to%20rebuild%20the%20latest%20state%20of%20accounts%20and%20balances%20on%20the%20rollup))

1. Then, how BLOBs are gonna help ZK-Rollups? (Both are doing the same thing: Keep the main net light)
2. ZK-Rollups are costly compared to Optimistic Rollups with Blobs. If yes, why can't we research more on ZK-Rollups rather than on BLOBs. (ZK-Rollups have faster transaction finality and easy to verify)

,t3 _ 1e1g3ja,ethereum,Problem of combining contract funds across multiple L2s,"I am planning to make a smart contract. Long story short, I made an AI trading bot and it has been doing pretty well for almost 3 years. The AI is especially good at trading ETH/USDT or ETH/USDC pairs. My plan is to make a smart contract, let people deposit funds in, let the AI trade with those funds, and I take part of the realized gain as commission.

There will be a token representing shares of the pooled funds, I plan to call it JCT. Its value always equals to the total funds in the pool divided by the total JCT supply. When the pool has 500k USDC, 300 ETH and the current supply of JCT is 10k, each JCT can redeem 50 USDC and 0.03 ETH trustlessly. When people deposit money in, the contract issues new JCT based on the current price. When people withdraw money, the contract burns the JCT.

My address will be the admin address. The admin address can only do the following things:

1. Swap ETH/USDC via Uniswap.
2. Set commission percentage (between 0 and 1).

So there is no chance I can steal the funds, commission can only be taken from realized gain (the formula will be hardcoded in the contract). The only risk is I (the AI bot) made many bad swaps and run the funds to zero, but that's not likely given it has been performing well for almost 3 years, and when it start to go south, users can always withdraw. The design is to be as trustless as possible.

But here is the problem, how do I implement this across multiple L2s?

Ideally, the value of JCT should equal to the total funds in all networks divided by the total supply of JCT in all networks. But is it even possible to make contract aware of the funds in other networks? If I run this contract independently in each L2, eventually they will drift apart from each other due to different fees and slightly different swap prices.

* (At present) disinflationary due to burn rate; not so negative in the face of long term holding in this particular area
* Staking (at least if you have a lot of ether or you want to be a part of a staking pool)
* NFTs (I mean some people think that's important, right?)
* Good history for going up in value already, and a better record in this area than BTC, making it potentially more bullish; Spot ETF on the way already too

,t3 _ 1du3t0n,ethereum,"Panarchy system with proof-of-unique-human, people-vote Nakamoto consensus and UBI, accepting citizens...","I was one of the first ""proof of unique human"" projects on Ethereum or modern blockchain technology, originally on the domain [proofofindividuality.online](http://proofofindividuality.online) in 2015 (some may remember that one), and gradually built out a system that now has people-vote (rather than coin-vote or cpu-vote) block production and validation, and an *ideal* random number generator, and universal basic income through *ideal* taxation. What it does not have is citizens. It's a ""nation state"" without a people. The modified Ethereum consensus engine is not perfect (implementation of it can be improved), but, it works, probably well enough to support a population of a few million people. Long term, the underlying digital ledger technology has to get *a lot* faster, if it is to support 8 billion people.

Anyone interested in joining as a citizen, reach out via a comment or message here or somewhere else, and you'll get an invite. The way the population grows is by invites (""opt-in tokens""), and these are distributed via the population (the population votes about how many to produce each month. Initially it was one per person but there is a minor attack vector and the ability to minimize invite ""window"" prevents it fully. ) When opting-in, you are assigned under a pair, rather than in a pair (preventing attack vector by creating a trillion new fake accounts... ) So, anyone interested in becoming a citizen can be sent an ""opt-in token"".

Universal basic income, as well as rewards for voting on validators, are available to citizens (although the latter has to be done manually, since consensus engine interface did not allow it to be done in automated way. But it is quite easy to achieve it manually too, for now. )

The source code and enodes and RPC nodes and such: [https://github.com/resilience-me/panarchy](https://github.com/resilience-me/panarchy)

*Note, similar people-vote platforms can be produced and launched for traditional nation-states too. Very simple. Could happen within a few years, and make voting for governments and such incorruptible. But the random number generator mine uses is probably overcomplicated then, and I recommend doing commit-reveal with each validator pre-committing a hash onion. Similar to RANDAO and probably what Casper uses except with validators as those who contribute random numbers. I built a version with that first, before switching to the ideal RNG.*",0.7,15,0,15,Ethereum,2024-07-03 02:44:24

,t3 _ 1dtrxph,ethereum,Ethereum ETF: Key Moments,"**On May 23, the US Securities and Exchange Commission approved Spot Ether (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs).** ETFs are packaged in a way that traditional investors understand and are comfortable with, making them an accessible entry point into the digital asset market.

This approval marks a significant milestone, as it is expected to increase institutional demand for Ethereum. In our article, we explore Ethereum ETFs as a gateway to digital asset investment — read the full material here: [everstake.one/blog/ethereum-etfs-gateway-to-digital-asset-investment](http://everstake.one/blog/ethereum-etfs-gateway-to-digital-asset-investment)

One notable aspect of the ETF approval is that it does not include staking 😢

The SEC's regulatory stance has influenced ETF issuers to exclude staking from their proposals due to compliance concerns.

The Commission considers staking services as potentially unregistered securities offerings, which has led to regulatory actions against major crypto platforms like Coinbase and Kraken for offering staking services without proper registration.

To avoid similar legal challenges, ETF issuers decided to omit staking from their offerings.

The absence of staking in ETFs is still good news for those who are already staking their ETH. Without staking options in ETFs, there is more portion of rewards for existing stakers. This occurs because every ETH holder who chooses not to stake indirectly increases the rewards for those who do, as rewards are less diluted across validators.

**Whether staking will be included in ETFs in the future remains uncertain.**

The regulatory landscape is constantly evolving, and the inclusion of staking in ETFs may depend on how regulations and compliance requirements develop or decease over time.

*You always can stake ETH with Everstake to earn rewards now:* [https://everstake.one/link/stake-ethereum](https://everstake.one/link/stake-ethereum)

To begin utilizing the benefits of the newly approved Ethereum ETFs, **an S-1 filing must be approved by the SEC.**

Last month, Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas predicted that the SEC would approve these ETFs by July 2, but here we are … and this didn’t happen.

On June 29, an insider told The Block that the SEC had asked prospective issuers to address specific comments in their applications and to resubmit them by July 8.

However, industry watchers are not entirely convinced that the SEC will approve the current batch of applications this week. So are we 💁🏻‍♀️

In addition, an insider noted that they anticipate further rounds of back-and-forth between the applicants and the SEC before final approvals are granted.

One more significant part of an Ethereum ETF puzzle is an update from the Consensys case. Recently the latter announced that **the SEC Enforcement Division closed its investigation into Ethereum 2.0, also known as PoS.**

This decision is a major victory not only for the company but for the whole Ethereum community, as it removes a significant regulatory uncertainty hanging over the Ethereum ecosystem.

However, the SEC drama isn’t completely over — the Commission recently announced that they are charging Consensys with engaging in the unregistered offer and sale of securities through #MetaMask and operating as an unregistered broker.

[https://x.com/Consensys/status/1803230653120659641](https://x.com/Consensys/status/1803230653120659641)

**Overall, the outlook for Ethereum appears promising**.

The potential approval of Ethereum ETFs, coupled with the closure of the SEC's investigation into Ethereum 2.0, signals positive momentum for the digital asset. These developments are likely to enhance investor confidence and support further growth and adoption of Ethereum.

As someone who’s helped build and launch several dApps, I realized that much development work is repetitive. We all know the drill: Smart Contracts, Data Flow, dApp Architecture, and Interfaces. It got me thinking about how we could streamline this process.

So, I took some time off from hands-on development to focus on a solution, and I’m excited to introduce [Web3Wizz](https://web3wizz.com)! It’s still in its early stages but designed to simplify some of the most time-consuming parts of dApp development.

Here’s what it does:

    1.	You paste your smart contract address.
    2.	Select the functions you want to share with your audience.
    3.	Add your brand colors.

And just like that, Web3Wizz generates interactive, bug-free, slick widgets for your smart contract. You can integrate these widgets into your React website, a simple index.html, or even share them directly with others. Plus, everything is hosted decentralized, with only you having the power to update addresses.

If you’re a dApp builder or working on a crypto protocol, I’d love for you to check it out. As a small thank you to this community, I’m offering a promo for the first 20 users who PM me with their project details. Hopefully, Web3Wizz can save you time and hassle in your development process.

The only reason I found out about the breach was becasue I got a notification saying two of our NFTs were sold successfully. WTF?

,t3 _ 1dpvdnn,ethereum,Recent slashing incidents on the Ethereum mainnet,"Noticed two Ethereum slashing incidents several days ago?

**The same user/entity was slashed twice less in 24 hours after having been activated on the network due to attestation violations, likely caused by infrastructure issues. This unfortunate event led to the forceful removal of its validators and ETH losses.**

Safe and sound infrastructure is the backbone of ETH staking. Evergreen base — test everything on the testnet before embarking on the mainnet journey!

*It's crucial for validators to understand all risks and take precautions to avoid unintentional slashing.*

*To mitigate the risk of slashing those running multiple validators should focus on the following:*

🔹 Implementing continuous monitoring solutions. \*

🔹 Developing a set of best practices \*

🔹 Having risk containment measures in place. \*

*🔹 Having a dedicated DevOps team.*

Proud to share that Everstake\_pool has had zero slashing events since Ethereum PoS genesis in December 2020 and we currently manage 21,000+ active validators.

Check out one of our first Ethereum operators, running smoothly for 4 years:

,t3 _ 1dozpu3,ethereum,Who to Watch in the Next-Gen VM Race?,"I stumbled upon a tweet by (@ayyyeandy) that got me really excited about the future of blockchain virtual machines. Here are some key players to watch:

* Fuel network: FuelVM &amp; Sway language are set to go live on mainnet this summer, offering native account abstraction and a UTXO-based model.
* LUMIO: They are developing a modular VM abstraction framework that can bring Solana (and other VM) apps to different execution environments. Their testnet is already live.
* Fluent: Known for ""blended execution,"" which combines the best aspects of different VMs in one place. More updates coming soon.
* Movement: MoveVM focuses on formal verification and enhanced security for users and builders. A public testnet should be available soon.
* Cartesi: They are integrating LinuxVM/Risc-V into blockchains with app-specific rollups. This is already live with ongoing experimentation.

Other noteworthy mentions include:

* Eclipse: SVM
* Arbitrum: Stylus
* Initia: PoL
* Berachain: Polaris EVM with PoL
* Dymension: Cosmos SDK PoS

To achieve the best outcomes, a combination of Solana’s parallelization and local fee markets, Ethereum’s security, Cosmos’s interoperability, and Aptos’ programmable security is essential. This must be executed in a state-minimized manner to prevent state bloat.

While I believe the EVM is here to stay, the innovation in the next-gen VM space is truly thrilling.

1. the ease of transaction under anonimity

2. cross-border transactions are more secure and faster with defi especially on Ethereum and EVM dependent networks.

With the continued exploration of the power of blockchain, defi might just become the new way to make transactions in the future.

**Common problems &amp; solutions**

**1. Crypto withdrawal suspended**

● You receive a message saying ‘withdrawal suspended due to risk control’ and have been trying to unlock your account.

● Don’t worry, your funds are SAFU. Our agents will try their best to help unlock the withdrawal - please coordinate with our team and provide relevant information when prompted to do so.

● Withdrawal Risk can be triggered by a number of reasons. Risk control is extremely important. Please note that we can only help you if we deem your case to be legitimate, if you have attempted to hack an account and request for unsuspension, you will be unsuccessful as we have processes in place to prevent this.

Our team works extremely hard to resolve these issues as soon as possible and some cases can take time to resolve but please keep in mind the reason for this is to ensure you, our users, are safe.

**Cases replied by our mods are already in the escalation process. A longer wait after escalation = our team is working hard at investigating the issue.** If there are any updates to the case, our agents will reply to you directly in the chat.

Please refrain from leaving multiple messages in this thread if your case has already been escalated.

**2. Security issues**

● Report hacked accounts and funds.

● *Note: It can take up to several working days for the money to be credited to your accounts.* [You can find more FAQ here](https://twitter.com/BinanceHelpDesk/status/1391776637071478787)

**4. US persons accessing old Binance.com accounts for offboarding &amp; withdrawal of funds**

● Your funds are SAFU. If you experience issues with withdrawing remaining funds, follow the above steps to get to our live chat queue - our agents will try our best to assist you with the offboarding.

**5. Trading system and other account issues**

● Spot, margin &amp; futures trading

**Common problems &amp; solutions**

**1. Crypto withdrawal suspended**

● You receive a message saying ‘withdrawal suspended due to risk control’ and have been trying to unlock your account.

● Don’t worry, your funds are SAFU. Our agents will try their best to help unlock the withdrawal - please coordinate with our team and provide relevant information when prompted to do so.

● Withdrawal Risk can be triggered by a number of reasons. Risk control is extremely important. Please note that we can only help you if we deem your case to be legitimate, if you have attempted to hack an account and request for unsuspension, you will be unsuccessful as we have processes in place to prevent this.

Our team works extremely hard to resolve these issues as soon as possible and some cases can take time to resolve but please keep in mind the reason for this is to ensure you, our users, are safe.

**Cases replied by our mods are already in the escalation process. A longer wait after escalation = our team is working hard at investigating the issue.** If there are any updates to the case, our agents will reply to you directly in the chat.

**4. US persons accessing old Binance.com accounts for offboarding &amp; withdrawal of funds**

**Common problems &amp; solutions**

**1. Crypto withdrawal suspended**

● You receive a message saying ‘withdrawal suspended due to risk control’ and have been trying to unlock your account.

● Don’t worry, your funds are SAFU. Our agents will try their best to help unlock the withdrawal - please coordinate with our team and provide relevant information when prompted to do so.

● Withdrawal Risk can be triggered by a number of reasons. Risk control is extremely important. Please note that we can only help you if we deem your case to be legitimate, if you have attempted to hack an account and request for unsuspension, you will be unsuccessful as we have processes in place to prevent this.

Our team works extremely hard to resolve these issues as soon as possible and some cases can take time to resolve but please keep in mind the reason for this is to ensure you, our users, are safe.

**Cases replied by our mods are already in the escalation process. A longer wait after escalation = our team is working hard at investigating the issue.** If there are any updates to the case, our agents will reply to you directly in the chat.

Please refrain from leaving multiple messages in this thread if your case has already been escalated.

**2. Security issues**

● *Note: It can take up to several working days for the money to be credited to your accounts.* [You can find more FAQ here](https://twitter.com/BinanceHelpDesk/status/1391776637071478787)

**4. US persons accessing old Binance.com accounts for offboarding &amp; withdrawal of funds**

● Your funds are SAFU. If you experience issues with withdrawing remaining funds, follow the above steps to get to our live chat queue - our agents will try our best to assist you with the offboarding.

**Common problems &amp; solutions**

**1. Crypto withdrawal suspended**

● You receive a message saying ‘withdrawal suspended due to risk control’ and have been trying to unlock your account.

● Don’t worry, your funds are SAFU. Our agents will try their best to help unlock the withdrawal - please coordinate with our team and provide relevant information when prompted to do so.

● Withdrawal Risk can be triggered by a number of reasons. Risk control is extremely important. Please note that we can only help you if we deem your case to be legitimate, if you have attempted to hack an account and request for unsuspension, you will be unsuccessful as we have processes in place to prevent this.

Our team works extremely hard to resolve these issues as soon as possible and some cases can take time to resolve but please keep in mind the reason for this is to ensure you, our users, are safe.

**Cases replied by our mods are already in the escalation process. A longer wait after escalation = our team is working hard at investigating the issue.** If there are any updates to the case, our agents will reply to you directly in the chat.

**Common problems &amp; solutions**

**1. Crypto withdrawal suspended**

● You receive a message saying ‘withdrawal suspended due to risk control’ and have been trying to unlock your account.

● Don’t worry, your funds are SAFU. Our agents will try their best to help unlock the withdrawal - please coordinate with our team and provide relevant information when prompted to do so.

● Withdrawal Risk can be triggered by a number of reasons. Risk control is extremely important. Please note that we can only help you if we deem your case to be legitimate, if you have attempted to hack an account and request for unsuspension, you will be unsuccessful as we have processes in place to prevent this.

Our team works extremely hard to resolve these issues as soon as possible and some cases can take time to resolve but please keep in mind the reason for this is to ensure you, our users, are safe.

**Cases replied by our mods are already in the escalation process. A longer wait after escalation = our team is working hard at investigating the issue.** If there are any updates to the case, our agents will reply to you directly in the chat.

Please refrain from leaving multiple messages in this thread if your case has already been escalated.

**2. Security issues**

● *Note: It can take up to several working days for the money to be credited to your accounts.* [You can find more FAQ here](https://twitter.com/BinanceHelpDesk/status/1391776637071478787)

**4. US persons accessing old Binance.com accounts for offboarding &amp; withdrawal of funds**

● Your funds are SAFU. If you experience issues with withdrawing remaining funds, follow the above steps to get to our live chat queue - our agents will try our best to assist you with the offboarding.

**Common problems &amp; solutions**

**1. Crypto withdrawal suspended**

● You receive a message saying ‘withdrawal suspended due to risk control’ and have been trying to unlock your account.

● Don’t worry, your funds are SAFU. Our agents will try their best to help unlock the withdrawal - please coordinate with our team and provide relevant information when prompted to do so.

● Withdrawal Risk can be triggered by a number of reasons. Risk control is extremely important. Please note that we can only help you if we deem your case to be legitimate, if you have attempted to hack an account and request for unsuspension, you will be unsuccessful as we have processes in place to prevent this.

Our team works extremely hard to resolve these issues as soon as possible and some cases can take time to resolve but please keep in mind the reason for this is to ensure you, our users, are safe.

**Cases replied by our mods are already in the escalation process. A longer wait after escalation = our team is working hard at investigating the issue.** If there are any updates to the case, our agents will reply to you directly in the chat.

**4. US persons accessing old Binance.com accounts for offboarding &amp; withdrawal of funds**

Is there a good tax software that can accurately track my phantom/solflare wallet to retroactively track all my capital gains?

Have almost 2k trades in the past 3 months and would be nearly impossible to go through them.

Follow up- could I submit my capital gains as one trade and just overpay a little? Would I get in trouble for this if I paid the correct amount+a little but just didn’t accurately track the trades themselves?

Thank you for your time pretty stressed about this because I’ve made more than 10k from $20 so would rather just have it figure out now so I can stop stressing about it.

Furthermore, I’ve heard from some people that a lot of these services had them overpay so just curious about that.

Finally- I want to clarify that I need a service SPECIFICALLY for pump.fun trades on phantom and solflare. The other more established services don’t really do well with this from my understanding.

,t3 _ 1e4scb4,solana,Capital gains taxes pls help,"So basically I have a couple questions for yall who have filed your capital gains for Solana.

So I turned like $20 into more than 10k over a TON of trades we’re talking 1k different coins and 2k transactions total. I plan to keep trading until I have to declare my gains so this is only gonna become more. I mainly trade through pump fun using a phantom and solflare wallet.

My first question is- how well do tax software services work for this? I know I’ll prob have to pay since it’s so many tx and that’s fine but want to know if it’s gonna be a total headache for me.

My second question is- what happens if I pay the correct percentage of my total gains but don’t perfectly record every single trade. I’m assuming they would be more lenient with this since I still paid the correct amount but I’m curious if I would be penalized for that. I don’t want to do this but in the case that the software isn’t able to handle this much I may be forced to do this in order to not spend literally 100+ hours going through all my trades ever. 

My third question is if these tax software services work well for pump fun transactions. My friend said the services he tried didn’t really work well with the pump fun trades so wondering if there is a specific one that would deal with it well.

Finally my last question- I want to use sol incinerator to close all token accounts since I have a few sol in those total since I have so many transaction. Would this mess with how the tax software works?

THANK YOU SO MUCH IN ADVANCE. If you could answer one or all of these questions I would be abundantly thankful.

,t3 _ 1e4mplw,solana,"Write-up: The difference between SOL and ETH sh*tcoins, and how everything came to be.","I've been on ETH for 3 years now.  The bear market was brutal on everyone, but the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow was that retail would come back when it was over.  And they did, but not like degens expected. Retail didn't care for ETH's transaction fees, so retail went to SOL.

ETH degens thought they'd follow retail and cash in on that sweet, sweet liquidity... except degens didn't count on retail creating such a vastly different culture on SOL. They have a competitive edge here, but there's just too much based in luck.

SOL's culture was different because:

* Low transaction fees meant more paperhands, higher # of coins, quicker deaths for coins, and a faster rotation of metas
* No taxes meant teams needed to secure supply for profit.  SOL shunned bundling (which guarantees team supply), so teams had no way to secure it.  Without supply to pay KOLs, influencers took a nerf, and you see that today on SOL. Teams simply can't afford much marketing, and community isn't picking up that slack. Charts just die.
* As a dev on ETH, I can control my chart to an extent using marketing, market making, and my network.  On SOL that's not really a thing.
* The two main avenues to make money trading on ETH--etherscan tracking and social climbing--didn't translate to SOL well.  SOL replaced the skill of learning those with more dumb luck.

Shitcoins are a zero-sum game, someone has to lose for you to win, and the money in it is a vacuum. The more luck involved, the less your actions matter.  I don't like that.  There was so little merit recognition in the space already.

**ETH is/was a culture.**  You work your way up, learn a bunch of different skills, network, study a craft, and you get rich. It's an RPG.

**SOL is a roulette table.**  You hurl a little money at the chart and pray.  Nothing matters when it's a lottery.

The worst part, in my mind, is that if everyone on SOL played ETH, we'd have a real shot at holder culture, and things would be back to good the way they were 3 years ago.  Volume fixes everything.

I'm not arguing that it's all DIFFICULT, I'm arguing that it's IMPOSSIBLE to get a grasp of blockchain development in those circumstances. I honestly never experienced something this nature in any technology I picked up. Like, I'm literally going through a bootcamp on Solana's youtube channel posted 11 months ago and major functionalities are not only implemented differently, but none of the issues are addressed by the team nor are they addresses anywhere on the internet. 20 minutes of the video equaled to an hour of debugging. It also make me wonder how any projects are being developed (and I'm definetly not talking about memecoins) if library versions change so rapidly.

Anyway, I'm genuinely trying to learn and I'd love to hear from a developer what's his take on this or if I can get some recommendations to sources, because it's all so discouraging honestly.",1.0,12,0,12,Solana,2024-07-15 10:29:55

,t3 _ 1e3ucca,solana,How Do Crypto Wallets Make Money?,"* Whenever users perform crypto-based transactions using the wallet, a small fee is often charged. This fee is determined by the transaction's volume.
* Many crypto wallets integrate exchange services that allow users to trade one cryptocurrency for another directly within the wallet. Wallet providers often partner with cryptocurrency exchanges to facilitate these trades and earn a commission on each transaction.  
* Wallet providers that offer staking services may charge a fee or take a percentage of the staking rewards as a service charge.  
* Wallet providers can lend out the deposited cryptocurrencies to other users or institutions and earn interest. They share a portion of this interest with the users and keep the rest as profit.  
* Crypto Wallets can also partner with DeFi protocols to offer interest-bearing accounts, earning a commission from these partnerships.  
* Many crypto wallets are now offering premium features and services that require users to pay a subscription fee.   
* Users can subscribe to premium plans on a monthly or annual basis, providing a steady revenue stream for the wallet provider.  
* By promoting third-party services or products within the wallet interface, providers can earn commissions or advertising fees.
* Crypto wallets can also display ads from various cryptocurrency projects, exchanges, or other relevant services, earning revenue from clicks or impressions.  
* Crypto Wallet providers can also partner with other companies to promote their services and earn a commission for each user who signs up or makes a purchase through the wallet.  
* Some wallet providers launch their own tokens or support Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) within their platform. By issuing their own tokens, wallets can raise funds and generate revenue through token sales.

,t3 _ 1e3s801,solana,Is it possible to distribute my meme coin via community engagement.,"Hi all.

I’m creating a meme coin. My question is how I could go about distributing tokens via community engagement without it looking like a total scam which most are.

My idea is to incentivise community engagement where by anyone who contributes related memes that I find funny and match the theme I am going for get rewarded with the tokens. 

So let’s say I set up social media pages related to my category of memes. If community members send me memes via telegram that I later upload on to my social media and website they will be rewarded with a payment in the tokens. 

My worry is balancing retaining enough tokens to use as incentives and launching the token with enough availability supply so that it doesn’t look like I’m setting up a scam. 

From my research when devs hold on to too much of the supply it always looks suss. But you also run the danger of having bots arbitrage all my initial liquidity when it’s completely open. 

What would your guys ideas for good tokenomics be for this type of idea. I was thinking 20% devs (which I will use to incentivise) 70% burn and 10% tradable. 

Any advice would be much appreciated. I could be being be completely naive but again any help on token structure and if it’s even possible would be amazing. Cheers guys ",0.67,2,0,2,Solana,2024-07-15 11:16:01

I couldnt find a python sdk that recognizes sepolia base either, but im still unsure about the liquidity pool stuff or if there even are any

the USDC token has to match the circle faucet because synthetix's sdk has to recgonize it to put in as collateral

I can get the abi code for python if need be, but im unsure about which step here is missing or if theres something im overlooking with the liquidity

Also, it's very annoying when it doesn't calculate the gas charges into the equation, so everytime it says I don't have enough ETH for gas, so I have to lower the amount of coins I want to receive to cover the gas, just  to find out afterwards that there's still $50 of ETH sat in my account!

&amp;#x200B;

# Staking

Comment command: `?staking`

*You can find many comprehensive threads about staking on our 'explain it like I'm five sub'* [r/Cardano\_ELI5](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cardano_ELI5/)*.*

**Some posts regarding staking**

* [What does it mean to ""stake"" your ADA?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cardano_ELI5/comments/kwmli8/what_does_it_mean_to_stake_your_ada/)
* [How do I stake my ADA?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cardano_ELI5/comments/l01bfb/how_do_i_stake_my_ada/)
* [How do I pick a staking pool to stake my ADA with?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cardano_ELI5/comments/l004rh/how_do_i_pick_a_staking_pool_to_stake_my_ada_with/)
* [Where do staking rewards come from?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cardano_ELI5/comments/l0190d/where_do_staking_rewards_come_from/)
* [When will I receive my staking rewards](https://cardano-community.github.io/support-faq/#/rewards)
* [Staking on Daedalus (an IOHK video)](https://youtu.be/OUZKSS_cJIE)

**There are no risks staking on Cardano!**

* Your ADA is never locked. You're free send your ADA at any time.
* Your ADA is never moved from your wallet. You will always be in control of your ADA (read the above like 'What does it mean to ""stake"" your ADA?' to learn more).
* Your rewards are distributed by the protocol, so there's no possibility they can be withheld by a stake pool.

**There is no minimum to stake (though there is a staking key deposit of 2 ADA) and any ADA added to your wallet is automatically staked, including rewards (rewards are compounded). You only need to withdraw rewards if you need to send the ADA out of your wallet.**

&amp;#x200B;

# Stake Pools

Comment command: `?pools`

**Guides to decide which stake pool to delegate to:**

* [How do I pick a staking pool to stake my ADA with?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cardano_ELI5/comments/l004rh/how_do_i_pick_a_staking_pool_to_stake_my_ada_with/)
* [Selecting Pool for delegation](https://cardano-community.github.io/support-faq/#/select-pool-to-delegate)

**Stake pool comparison sites**

The community has built many invaluable tools for you to compare stake pool statistics:

* [PoolTool](https://pooltool.io/)
* [Adapools](https://adapools.org/)
* [ADAex](https://adaex.org/)
* [Cardanoscan](https://cardanoscan.io/)
* [AdaTools](https://adatools.io/)
* [Pool.pm](https://pool.pm/)
* [PoolStats](https://poolstats.org/)
* [PoolPeek](https://poolpeek.com/)

**When delegating try to:**

* Support pools that contribute to the community.
* Use wallets that allow you to select your own pool (like [Daedalus](https://daedaluswallet.io/) and [Yoroi](https://yoroi-wallet.com/#/)).
* Avoid staking with [large entities](https://adapools.org/groups) like Binance (It's bad for decentralisation and therefore the project).

**Make sure you visit** [r/CardanoStakePools](https://www.reddit.com/r/CardanoStakePools/)**!**

&amp;#x200B;

# Staking Fees

Comment command: `?fees`

**Staking Key Deposit**

When you make a delegation, it will cost you 2 ADA for a staking key deposit, plus the standard transaction fee (usually \~0.17 ADA). The key deposit is something you'll get back if you ever undelegate the wallet.

Stake Pool Fees

Pool fees are commonly misunderstood. Firstly let's clarify that pool fees are not a direct cost to you, the delegator! Fees are simply the pools share of rewards when they are distributed.

**Fixed fee**

This is a set amount of ADA the pool earns (min. 340 ADA). *e.g If the fixed fee = 340 ADA: If a a pool earns 20000 ADA, the pool gets 340 ADA, and it's delegators get 19,600 ADA.*

**Variable fee (aka pool margin)**

The variable fee is a percentage of rewards the pool earns. *e.g. If the variable fee = 1%: If a pool earns 20000 ADA, the pool gets 200 ADA, and it's delegators get 19,800 ADA.*

*Note treasury tax not included in examples for simplicity.*

**When making a delegation try to:**

* Support pools that contribute to the community.
* Use wallets that allow you to select your own pool (like [Daedalus](https://daedaluswallet.io/) and [Yoroi](https://yoroi-wallet.com/#/)).
* Avoid staking with [large entities](https://adapools.org/groups) like Binance (It's bad for decentralisation and therefore the project).

**Make sure you visit** [r/CardanoStakePools](https://www.reddit.com/r/CardanoStakePools/)**!**

&amp;#x200B;

# Rewards

Comment command: `?rewards`

There are 3 incentive mechanisms that allow the community to earn rewards in ADA:

**Staking Rewards**

Staking is incentivised as it's important for network function as intended. See:

* [What does it mean to ""stake"" your ADA?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cardano_ELI5/comments/kwmli8/what_does_it_mean_to_stake_your_ada/)
* [Rewards FAQ](https://cardano-community.github.io/support-faq/#/rewards)
* [Staking Calculator](https://cardano.org/calculator/?calculator=delegator)
* [Where do staking rewards come from?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cardano_ELI5/comments/l0190d/where_do_staking_rewards_come_from/)

Simply delegate your ADA in a Shelley wallet and you'll earn a passive income!

*Note that when you initially delegate, it'll take 15-20 days until you first receive rewards depending on your pool's performance, then every 5 days after (see rewards FAQ).*

Your rewards depend on the balance during the epoch snapshot (as detailed in the FAQ). That means:

* Rewards are compounded - rewards are added to your main balance and thus are captured in the next epoch snapshot which goes through the delegation cycle for increased rewards.
* Any additional ADA you add to the wallet increases your rewards (again once the balance has been captured in a snapshot and has gone through the delegation cycle).

**Community Advisor Rewards**

In [Project Catalyst](https://cardano.ideascale.com/) you can earn rewards be writing thoughful reviews on proposal projects as a community advisor.

Sign up to the [ideascale platform](https://cardano.ideascale.com/) and make sure to read the [community advistor guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QkdaFK1tigrSI40iMeV3UP9GyTGsoqVmCUp7OJz0WFs/edit).

**Voting Rewards**

Voting is another important part of being a community member, as and ADA holder you hold voting power. Our treasury funds projects proposed on Project Catalyst, and with Voltaire we'll soon be voting on [Cardano's Improvement Proposals (CIPS)](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs). Voting is incentivised to encourage participation. Be sure to download the Catalyst Voting app on [android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.iohk.vitvoting&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=US) and [ios](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1517473397).

# Safety and Scams

Comment command: `?scams`

*Always be vigilant - especially on Youtube with 'giveaway' scams!* [(See this post to see what they look like)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/10kf1kb/cardano_scam_in_2021_all_72_screenshots/)

* Never share your recovery seed phrase.
* Never accept advice via direct messages - scammers will prey on you and talk you out of your money. Ask questions publicly!
* Never send your crypto to someone promising to send more back (youtube 'giveaway' scam) - [See advanced fee scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam#:~:text=An%20advance%2Dfee%20scam%20is,to%20obtain%20the%20large%20sum.)
* Always download wallets from a trusted sources, and be aware there are imitation wallets in app stores - if in doubt, ask!

**Questions ?**

Please feel free to ask questions here or in posts, but **please** be sure to make search first so we don't have to keep repeating ourselves/making redundant posts. The Cardano community are helpful and your question will always get answered. 



**SCAMS**

Be aware of scams and scammers, always follow the rule, ""**Don't trust, verify**"". Always publicly verify whether a source of information/offer is true and don't let greed violate that rule. Be cautious before connecting your wallet to any site, entering your seed phrase or sending ADA to an unknown wallet. Scammers often approach people in private messages and imitate legitimate people and entities. Do not be fooled, almost anything can be faked like the number of subscribers, viewer count, video (ai can generate fake videos), verification status.  No your wallet does not need to be verified. No there are no ADA giveaways. For more details, use the newbies guide.

,t3 _ 1e52duv,cardano,"Catalyst, a way to finance projects, and throw money down the drain","First of all, I have been with Cardano for more than 5 years, I have been there through thick and thin, I have defended the project and I have created a website to promote it in the Spanish-speaking world. Having said that, I would like to give a brief opinion on one thing in particular that I don't like about Catalyst, and that is the way in which money is wasted on certain projects.

First of all I am neither a programmer nor a developer, so I am not in conditions to evaluate if the money that these projects receive is adequate for what they really intend to do, so I am not going to talk about this. I will only limit myself to say that thanks to Catalyst very interesting projects that help the community have been developed.

However, what I am going to talk about is those projects that receive huge amounts of ADA to “promote” the ecosystem.

Every ADA, in my opinion, is important. We, the ADA holders, have a responsibility to deliver each ADA responsibly, and I see projects that, in my opinion, these ADAs should not be spent. I have seen Catalyst results in FUND 9,10,11 and 12 and I have always noticed people asking for huge amounts of ADAs for “promoting the ecosystem”. I find it really questionable that we have to give for example:

* ₳79,028, $34,454 on “to \[CASIA\] Cardano Asia TikTok Channel (expand Korean, maintain Japanese/Vietnamese/English) + NEW Youtube Channel.”, which has gotten more abstentions than positive votes. Are you telling me that it costs almost $35,000 to make tiktok videos and open a Youtube channel? When there are thousands who promote Cardano this way for free for the love of the project?
* ₳57,150 in “\[FIMI\] Cardano podcast on Telegram for Vietnamese”. $25,000 to make a Cardano podscat on telegram?
* ₳74,900 on \[FIMI\] Blockchain course for Vietnamese. 33,000$ on a Cardano course?
* ₳18,838 on Spanish Content for Social Media, Onboarding, and Education. Many Spaniards promote Cardano through content and you are telling me that you need $8,500 to do it? Really?

I could go on, but I just put this as an example. There are countries where $200 is the minimum wage and we are paying 100, 200 or 300 times more for this stuff.Really?

Have I missed somewhere along the line and there is something else I am not understanding?

Every day I see hundreds of people who put their effort in promoting Cardano without asking for anything in return, giving tens of thousands of ADA and dollars to others for something that doesn't deserve that money should not be Catalyst's direction.

As I say, I have been in Cardano for many years, but I think the direction that Catalyst is taking of wastefulness in certain aspects as if ADA is growing from trees is something that concerns me.

Please understand that this is constructive criticism and that English is not my language, I am sorry if you notice that I am not expressing myself completely correctly.

  
Edit: If you are interested in the topic, also look at the comments, there is a great debate about this Catalyst problem and other examples",0.99,81,0,81,cardano,2024-07-16 22:52:27

While many other DExes have been using Plutus V2 for a longer time, Minswap was still running on V1.

This contributed to faster network congestion. That has changed. Minswap migrated to Plutus V2. Now, it is up to 10 times more efficient. It is worth noting that the team used Aiken to develop the new version. Many interesting improvements come with the transition to the new V2 contract.

,t3 _ 1dzxvo5,cardano,Polkadot now available on Cardano ,"Wanchain announced that $DOT, Polkadot's native token, can now be bridged to Cardano. This means $DOT holders can transfer their tokens to Cardano and receive a wrapped version of $DOT. This update opens up new opportunities for Polkadot users to explore the Cardano ecosystem and allows Cardano users to bridge the wrapped $DOT back to Polkadot, expanding their access to both ecosystems.

How to bridge over to Cardano?
To bridge your $DOT to Cardano, start by heading over to the Wanchain Bridge. Choose Polkadot as your 'From Chain' and select $DOT. You'll need to connect your Polkadot.JS wallet at this point. Next, pick Cardano as your 'To Chain' and select $DOT as the asset. Connect your Cardano wallet or enter your Cardano address, specify the amount of $DOT you want to bridge, and click 'Next'. Finally, sign the transaction, and your $DOT will be successfully bridged to the Cardano blockchain.

,t3 _ 1dy9ip8,cardano,Cardano for Bitcoiner's Continued...,"Cardano for Bitcoiners is a mini-series analyzing criticisms, misconceptions and popular narratives with the aim to find valuable common ground between two hugely influential blockchain communities. With the recent release of part 4 here's a recap, brief summary and link to all current episodes:

**Episode 1: The Myths and Misconceptions** [https://youtu.be/2CsfHwOpCUc](https://youtu.be/2CsfHwOpCUc)

Part one analyzes blockchain trust, Cardano's three founding entities, the ADA pre-mine and the dangers surrounding blockchain upgradability. Bitcoin and Cardano are two juggernauts of crypto in their own right,. One gave birth to the entire industry and continues to attract global adoption through market dominance. The other is a third generation blockchain built with many of the same design architectures and values but through secure smart contract programmability and POS consensus driving decentralization, is taking that next evolutionary step to deliver a global financial and social operating system. But are a collection of outdated misconceptions and or genuine concerns holding back a huge (Bitcoin) community from exploring a blockchain (Cardano) that has all the characteristics to become Bitcoin 2.0?

**Episode 2: Intrinsic Value Proof of Work vs Proof of Stake** [https://youtu.be/3Dy7VS1t\_Bg](https://youtu.be/3Dy7VS1t_Bg)

Part 2 analyzes the intrinsic value of proof-of-work and proof-of-stake consensus mechanisms to understand how they match up. In blockchain the proof of work and proof of stake debate continues to roll on, which adds more intrinsic value, is more decentralized, scalable and secure? All extremely important questions the answers to which are often muddied by tribalism and misinformation, fueled by the desire to protect self-interest over driving real innovation. If we truly want this industry to succeed it’s high time we take a more objective approach. Proof of work and Proof of stake are riddled with trade-offs but the consensus amongst many bitcoiners is that Proof of work is far superior. Here we will unpack this opinion to understand: are all proof of stake blockchains the same, in what aspects do they excel and can a blockchain ever produce Bitcoin level security with a PoS consensus mechanism?

**Episode 3: Worshiping Idols, Cults and Divisive Figures** [https://youtu.be/ERZOHzAy4bU](https://youtu.be/ERZOHzAy4bU)

Part 3 explores the worshiping of idols, cult narratives, divisive founders and decentralized governance in blockchain. We delve into comparisons between Satoshi Nakamoto and Charles Hoskinson, analyze cult like behaviors in both communities, explore the divisive nature of blockchain leaders or founders and discuss the pathway to truly decentralized governance. Many share the opinion that charismatic leaders and influential voices in both the Cardano and Bitcoin communities dominate the discourse, leading to echo chambers where dissent is stifled, and truly decentralized governance is claimed to be compromised by idol worship and gatekeepers. But what if blockchain as a system could transcend this? What if the power of blockchain could be reclaimed by its community, steering away from these social pitfalls? Moreover what if this has been built into the roadmap and vision all along? This episode delves into the heart of these issues, explores the impacts of these social constructs and reveals the pathway toward genuine, liquid and representative democratic governance in the blockchain space.

**Episode 4: Programmable Assets, Blockchain Treasuries and DID's** [https://youtu.be/P\_1MHu6kqgo](https://youtu.be/P_1MHu6kqgo)

Part 4 focusses on the centralization of programmable assets (CBDCs), blockchain treasuries and decentralized identifiers (DID's). Do these innovations enhance blockchains utility or challenge the very principles this industry was founded upon? In the realm of blockchain innovation, where trust is etched in code and the promise of decentralization echoes through the corridors of this industry, a critical question emerges: Are we veering off course? Self-proclaimed purists warn of a significant threat, arguing that these innovations threaten the very ethos of blockchain. But are these fears justified? What if the fears of centralization are just the beginning of a new chapter where a balance of embracing innovation and incorporating it into an already largely decentralized blockchain will enable it to evolve into something far more akin to an ultra-inclusive world financial and social operating system? 

***A big thank you to everyone tuning into the series and showing support for the channel. Part 5 is coming soon where we will conclude some final criticisms or misconceptions. Part 6, the series finale will explore Cardano's unique advantages! Thanks for reading, keep it blockchain and definitely keep it Cardano!*** ",0.98,64,0,64,cardano,2024-07-08 13:54:50

EMURGO is thrilled to announce that the Anzens USDA stablecoin will launch under the seasoned crypto team Encryptus, with the EMURGO team continuing to support the upcoming launch as a technology provider. 

[*Stay informed on launch news by signing up at the newly launched website*](https://www.anzens.com/)

Last year, we faced significant headwinds when bringing USDA stablecoin to market and [promised an exploration](https://www.emurgo.io/press-news/a-product-update-on-anzens-and-usda-stablecoin/) of alternative ways to launch.  The upcoming launch under Encryptus marks a delivery on our promise with a team ideally positioned to take USDA to new heights.

USDA to be Launched by Experienced Institutional-Grade Trading Desk Encryptus

Founded in 2021, Encryptus empowers high-volume users with secure and efficient crypto transactions, offering large-scale crypto pay-ins and payouts. Encryptus’ trading desk model removes intermediaries, offers competitive fees, and provides seamless transactions with the option to convert to local currencies. In addition to their experience, Encryptus is a compliance-centric crypto team. With a European license, VASP status in Lithuania, and the largest payout network spanning 80+ countries, their industry-leading off-ramp services ensure regulatory compliance and user confidence.

With a strong background in large-scale efficient crypto transactions, Encryptus is also no stranger to Cardano. They have already partnered with EMURGO, working with the Yoroi Wallet team to integrate an off-ramp solution to allow ADA-to-fiat conversions in the mobile version of the wallet, expanding the functionality for those times when Cardano users need to settle in the real world. 

[*Read the Announcement: ADA-to-Fiat Offramp Now in Yoroi Wallet via Encryptus*](https://www.emurgo.io/press-news/ada-to-fiat-offramp-now-in-yoroi-wallet-via-encryptus/)

USDA users can count on Encryptus to be dedicated to building the future of USDA, a fully backed stablecoin native to Cardano that users can manage autonomously, transferring it to anyone, quickly and cheaply.  

The Encryptus team has years of experience running a compliant trading desk and building relationships with high-volume users in the crypto world, focusing on empowering businesses and emerging markets with a regulation-first approach.

Look forward to exciting new features such as: 

* Worldwide off-ramps: Seamlessly buy USDA against widely used currencies, with off-ramping capabilities in 80+ countries.
* Access to frontier markets: Connecting emerging economies to developed ones by providing affordable liquidity.
* Simplifying access to Web3: Bridging the gap to traditional financial services for businesses and individuals in need.

And much more!

EMURGO’s Evolution and Support

Building on the extensive expertise acquired in developing a tokenization platform last year, EMURGO is uniquely positioned to deliver robust and innovative blockchain infrastructure support to the Encryptus team. 

This collaboration also extends to any business seeking to tokenize real-world assets.  

As the technology provider behind the Anzens platform, EMURGO looks forward to enabling the new features envisioned by Encryptus.  The goal is to assist in a seamless transition with the same ethos that meets and exceeds users’ needs.

Looking Forward

Looking ahead during this transition period, EMURGO and Encryptus are heads down collaborating to evolve and launch Anzens USDA.

[*Stay informed on launch news by signing up at the newly launched website*](https://www.anzens.com/)

Last year, we faced significant headwinds when bringing USDA stablecoin to market and [promised an exploration](https://www.emurgo.io/press-news/a-product-update-on-anzens-and-usda-stablecoin/) of alternative ways to launch.  The upcoming launch under Encryptus marks a delivery on our promise with a team ideally positioned to take USDA to new heights.",0.94,32,0,32,cardano,2024-07-08 16:03:57

,t3 _ 1dwxpw8,cardano,Input Endorsers &amp; Parallelism in dApps,"Hey everyone,   
I've been reading about EUTXO and how it bakes parallelism into the cake.   
  
But when I started looking for examples of parallelism in dApps, I couldn't find much.   
  
[I rediscovered an old article by the Sundae team](https://sundae.fi/posts/concurrency-state-cardano) and some tweets about what parallelism is, but other than that, I just found a bunch of opinions like 1) parallelism isn't much used yet, 2) it's one of the biggest hurdles for Cardano devs, and 3) we're waiting for input endorsers. 

So I looked into input endorsers – as thoroughly as my non-tech brain could handle – and while I see how they maximize network resources, I don't quite understand what they have to do with parallelism. 

If this is the answer ([from a nice article by Lucas Macchiavelli](https://cardanospot.io/news/cardanos-input-endorsers-an-explainer)), ""Input Endorsers allow us to pre-validate and pre-build blocks before they reach the consensus layer. This makes the whole system faster, as these processes can happen in parallel...""   
  
What does that do for dApp developers? 

Just asking for examples or hypotheticals.   
  
Thanks in advance!",0.89,14,0,14,cardano,2024-07-06 19:38:58
,t3 _ 1dwjuxs,cardano,"The past, the present and the future","Having switched  a sum of my portfolio over to Cardano on the recent negative news (all publicity is good publicity), I'd like to say what a great project this is and how excited I am of what it can become. The new chang hardfork will put the project in the hands of the people and they will guide it to new heights in my opinion. I was mining bitcoin in 2012 on a Windows app (unfortunately this pc was thrown out by my parents), everyone was laughing and criticising bitcoin  saying it was worthless. That negativity drove the community to new heights. I think this will be the same for Cardano, similarities at the moment are very much the same to those for Bitcoin back then. Yet this block chain has boundless opportunities to improve the world as a whole.

I cannot say I am a genius in blockchain language but I have been good a spotting a healthy investment opportunity. The journey will not be short, nor was it for the likes of Bitcoin, but it will be positive with a few bumps along the road.

I wonder if others feel this sentiment and see this opportunity?",0.96,76,0,76,cardano,2024-07-06 07:09:53

Lukas is known on X as Lukas (Computer) (handle: SCHIZO\_FREQ) is a data scientist for Remilia corporation (associated with miladymaker nft collection) and oxfun (3ac advised meme perp dex).   
  
Apart from excellent skills he has for crypto like other cool crypto people, Lukas is notoriously known for his podcast feats such as the abilities to entertain while being sarcastic and also explaining deep tech in a fun way all at the same time.

Recently, with oxfun's approach in doing X Spaces every day, Lukas has to take mic every day, literally every day. As for me, I join every single one of them as well as a background music for my working hours. Lukas who recently has took some interest in AVAX has become so vocal about on all his tweets and all of the X Spaces that he joins.

I've heard countless times already during these two weeks of everyday X Spaces where Lukas explain Avalanche's tech, direction, strategies and products to all fellow listeners and other speakers who join (these Spaces are free Spaces where anyone can request a mic, so there are new people who come up to join and ask so many questions every day.) All the feedback towards Lukas's AVAX shill are awesome!

This Lukas guy has been tweeting and explaining AVAX in a very eye/ear catching attention way that Avalanche people often retweet him themselves!

I am so glad that AVAX is getting some attentions again, at least from all these people I closely follow.

We are Virtune, a Swedish-regulated digital asset manager and issuer of crypto Exchange Traded Products (ETPs).

We are pleased to announce the launch of an Avalanche ETP on Nasdaq Stockholm, the largest stock exchange in the Nordic region.We support the Avalanche blockchain and aim to provide investors with an easy and secure way to exposure to AVAX via their broker or bank.

This is particularly important in Sweden, where owning actual cryptocurrencies may entail significantly higher capital gains taxes compared to investing through ETPs in a traditional investment account.

Our product offers 1:1 exposure to Avalanche and is 100% physically backed and collateralized meaning that an equivalent amount of AVAX corresponding to the issued shares is held through our custodian, Coinbase.

,t3 _ 1dqj3c6,Avax,Why Real World Asset Tokenization is Important For the DeFi Ecosystem?,"**Diversifying assets**

Real-world asset tokenization expands the range of assets that are involved in DeFi. Assets that were once difficult to buy and sell, like real estate and fine art, can now be turned into tokens and are used within DeFi protocols. This investment opportunity attracts a wide range of investors.

**Opportunity for Greater Liquidity**

Real-world asset (RWA) tokenization can increase liquidity and efficiency in both physical and digital markets by making physical assets easier to trade by breaking them into smaller, more affordable units and removing intermediaries. 

**Connecting Traditional Finance and DeFi**

RWA has the potential to connect traditional finance (TradFi) with decentralized finance (DeFi) and make the financial system more efficient. RWAs let asset owners use their existing assets to access the DeFi ecosystem, where there are low barriers, higher returns, and more innovation than TradFi. 

On the other hand, real-world assets can draw more money and interest from traditional finance (TradFi) to DeFi, boosting its adoption and growth. RWAs attract both big institutions and regular investors who prefer regulated and familiar assets. 

**Worldwide Access**

Real-world assets break down geographical barriers and allow investors from anywhere to invest in assets that were once restricted to specific locations. This will probably open up finance to more people globally.

,t3 _ 1dqfvge,Avax,"Unleashing Potential: Avalanche Mainnet Becomes a DeFi Powerhouse with Chainlink Integration
","**Unleashing High-Throughput DeFi Markets**

The deployment of [Chainlink](https://chain.link/) Data Streams on Avalanche signifies a major stride in the development of high-throughput DeFi products. By utilizing a pull-based oracle system, decentralized applications (dApps) can now access market data on-demand, thereby facilitating real-time interactions and transactions. 

This system mimics the operational dynamics of centralized platforms but with the added benefits of blockchain technology—decentralization, transparency, and security.

Johann Eid, Chief Business Officer at Chainlink Labs, emphasized the strategic importance of this integration. According to Eid, Data Streams not only enhance the operational capabilities of DeFi protocols on Avalanche but also ensure that these protocols can maintain robust security measures inherent to blockchain technologies. 

The potential for this technology extends beyond just trading platforms; it paves the way for a variety of high-performance applications across the DeFi ecosystem.

I converted yesterday on CoinBase Wallet, from **AVAX** to **Nuklai** (NAI). But I only received on my wallet a part of my tokkens. 

I converted **6.342 AVAX**, into Nuklai tokken; I expected to receive around 19000 NAI, but only received **2269.52**.

Transaction Hash : 0x923b01fac256c8cf571a53e6e57b418b3e5fffaac3147e34212a658f8b646377

To be honest, I'm new and don't understand all the details of these transactions. I know that there can be a difference when receiving after swap, but to receive only **8% of the transfer**, I think there is a problem.. 

I've already talked with the coinbase support, which redirects me to the Dex used for the transaction; problem is that they've already replied to other similar requests ""this board is to address only bugs related to routescan, we cannot help with lost funds"".

  
Voilà Voilà, I'm posting this here hoping to find a charitable soul who can explain to me where my $180 Nuklai is ? ...

,t3 _ 1dc4l1o,Avax,Kimbo bullish divergence just occurred,"Kimbo just printed the strongest bullish divergence possible on the 4 hour timeline. Bullish divergences precede reversal from bear trends to bull trends. Kimbo is a memecoin on the avax network, part of the avalanche rush program. It is trading on traderjoe and several other exchanges already, and is trending on twitter. It also has a smaller mcap than other memecoins like coq, allowing for more volatility to the upside and downside. Overall, this is a strong play, but risky with a high reward if it plays out well. The risk is asymmetrical to the reward imo though.

EDIT 6/10/2024 4:30 pm.   
Kimbo just moved up 4%, showing a clear bottom. This was predicted by the divergence. I am expecting a move of at minimum 10% to the upside. Without shorting mechanics, this remains incapable of an actual short squeeze, but dont underestimate people who sold at a loss fomoing back in with alot of salt as they see it going higher.

Moreover,  smart contracts take time to create and to optimize in a way that ensures performance and security. In this light, no code dapps have risen to fill that gap to take the technical work off the hands of crypto enthusiasts, among them are [MetaSender](https://www.metasender.co/), Multisender, Crypto Multisender among others.

**Top story:** USD-backed stablecoins collectively hold more U.S. Treasuries than countries such as Norway, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, and Germany, sitting just outside the top 10 holders of USTs.

USD-backed stablecoins could become one of the largest purchasers of U.S. Treasuries and prevent a debt crisis, reports the WSJ. Concerns around a potential debt crisis arise as funding for healthcare and retirement programs grow, historic buyers of U.S. debt retreat from the market, and digitized solutions facilitate the use of competing currencies in an increasingly multipolar world. 

If the DeFi sector continues to grow, stablecoins issued on public blockchains could underpin a reliable new source of demand for U.S. Treasuries, similar to Eurodollars, ultimately reducing the risk of a failed Treasury auction.

Polygon and Chainlink Labs hosted an XSpaces with Chainlink BUILD projects Arden ([@Arden\_Labs](https://x.com/Arden_Labs)), ICHI ([@ichifoundation](https://x.com/ichifoundation)), and XSwap ([@xswap\_link](https://x.com/xswap_link)), breaking down what it takes to be an entrepreneur.

* [Understanding Cross-Chain Token Transfers](https://chain.link/education-hub/cross-chain-token-transfers)

When a project implements an in-house cross-chain solution using arbitrary messaging &amp; custom token handling contracts, it can expose its protocol—and its users—to potential exploits. In contrast, CCIP provides a more secure alternative. Additionally, the seamless integration of Chainlink CCIP can lead to significant time and cost savings in development and maintenance. If you consider security and development speed as crucial factors, Chainlink CCIP is the ideal choice for cross-chain token transfers.

# Executive Summary

Litecoin is a peer-to-peer digital asset that enables near instant, low-cost payments to users worldwide. It was designed in 2011 with the goal to improve upon Bitcoin by offering faster transaction times and lower fees, making it a potentially attractive option for day-to-day exchanges and micro-payments.

Fidelity Digital Assets’ “Coin Report” series provides readers with a foundational understanding of a unique asset and examines its strengths and weaknesses. This report specifically highlights Litecoin and explores its long-term potential in the digital asset market, covering topics including: 

* How Litecoin seeks to provide a cost-effective alternative for both transactions and onboarding new users to Layer 2 solutions 
* An overview of existing competition from stablecoins and other blockchains as it relates to speed and affordability 
* Why Litecoin does not appear to be a serious competitor to bitcoin as a store of value based on its current state

Overall, steep competition from Bitcoin and other alternative coins along with scalability issues pose significant hurdles for the asset. However, Litecoin could still have a niche opportunity as both an onboarding option and testing ground for future Bitcoin upgrades.

I was a heavy day trader and % wise did very well, however the amount of time I spent on my phone and pc was outrageous. LTC was my first ever buy. No downtime faster and cheaper than btc and with what seemed like a decent community behind it is what sold to me. After a while my LTC holding doubled in value and I sold it and began my agressive day trading journey scalping and swinging my way through a vast array of hype and nonsense. After taking a few big losses in a row in 2021 I'd had enough of day trading crypto and refocused on renovating my house and setting my business up. Fast forward to now and I'm looking at what I want to put my money into on my quest for financial freedom and I've decided on 2 stock ETFS and... Litecoin. Why? Partly because it still looks as solid as it did when I originally bought. I can't see any negative news surrounding it outside of general noise and... the price is similar to what I originally paid? No other crypto I can remember from when I used to trade looks as oversold as LTC. Maybe I'm missing something but I feel I've gotten lucky reentering at 60 dollars. I'm aiming to add £200 gbp a week to my ltc holding until this price rises above 100 dollars after which I'll drop it to £100 a week and increase my stock etf buys. Has anyone else been away from ltx for some time and managed to re enter recently at these lower prices?

I'm looking at Litecoin, and we're both thinking of going this direction - but I was hoping to simplify the process as much as possible.

  
For example - it would be ideal, if he could easily generate an invoice with an LTC amount - send it to me, and I enter my (fiat) payment details. It then charges me, but sends to HIS wallet.

The way I see it, there's no need for me to also have an LTC wallet. It would be much more convenient to just have it go right from my fiat purchase, right to his LTC wallet.

Are there services to allow this? Or, can you recommend another more convenient path?

I think the price of Litecoin requires us to set up an organization to form a propaganda battle and consensus","I am from China, and although the situation of cryptocurrency investment in China is different, Litecoin is not worth considering among Chinese investors. It is also difficult to find analysis supporting Litecoin on the entire Chinese Internet. But I personally think that Litecoin has good future value. At least buying Litecoin at this stage will not cause you to lose your investment. Although I think the price of Litecoin may take more time to increase, I analyze that the electricity and equipment supporting Litecoin mining are the same sunk costs as Bitcoin. If this cost does not increase significantly, the support will be weak. , and then there’s people’s confidence in Litecoin’s future. I often tell people around me that the value of eth will become lower and lower due to technological updates, until in the end he only has the sunk costs of the POW mining period left. The values ​​of BCH and BSV can equal Litecoin in the long run, because in the end they are almost the same. It’s also similar to Bitcoin. The total market value of Litecoin is so low that a few wealthy people can acquire the entire market value of Litecoin. Therefore, we need to form an organization as soon as possible to publicize and tell people the truth. Those POS coins in the future are just technology applications and not coins.

,t3 _ 1dn30k1,litecoin,Fireside Chat: Alan Austin and Charlie Lee at WDMS,"# Fireside Chat Summary: Alan Austin and Charlie Lee at WDMS

# Introduction to Litecoin

* **Charlie Lee**:
   * Created Litecoin in 2011 as a CPU-mineable coin with scrypt mining, which was ASIC-resistant.
   * The goal was to make mining accessible to everyone and not compete directly with Bitcoin miners.
   * Initially, people used CPUs and later GPUs to mine Litecoin. ASIC mining for Litecoin was not considered during its creation.
   * Bitmain, now a significant ASIC manufacturer, plays a major role in Litecoin, Bitcoin, and Dogecoin mining.

# Proof of Work and Scrypt Mining

* **Why PoW and Scrypt?**
   * Bitcoin's PoW was a key innovation.
   * Chose scrypt to allow broader participation in the mining and avoid competition with Bitcoin miners.
   * PoS was untested, and scrypt ensured a separate set of miners for Litecoin.
* **13 Years Later**
   * Litecoin has had zero downtime since its inception, highlighting PoW's robustness.
   * PoW is essential for sound money like Litecoin, while PoS might be suitable for other projects.
   * PoW ensures stability through its mining algorithm and difficulty adjustment, which is crucial for Litecoin’s reliability as sound money.
   * PoS introduces complexity and more attack surfaces, making PoW more suitable for Litecoin’s goals.

# Merged Mining with Dogecoin

* **Background and Decision**
   * Dogecoin's rapid halving made it vulnerable to attacks.
   * Merged mining with Litecoin leveraged Litecoin’s hash rate to secure Dogecoin.
   * There was initial resistance from the Dogecoin community, but it proved to be a beneficial move.
* **Impact of Emission Schedules**
   * Litecoin's finite supply vs. Dogecoin's infinite supply.
   * Merged mining allows a unique experiment with constant emissions, providing long-term security.

# Privacy and Fungibility with MWEB

* **MWEB Introduction**
   * MWEB (MimbleWimble Extension Block) adds a privacy layer to Litecoin.
   * Enhances fungibility by ensuring transaction histories don't compromise privacy.
   * Addresses privacy concerns with Bitcoin’s public blockchain, ensuring transaction histories don’t compromise privacy.
   * MWEB is an optional feature, allowing users to choose privacy while maintaining usability and facilitating movement between the main chain and the extension block.

# Community and Adoption

* **Growth and Usage**
   * Litecoin sees around 300,000 daily transactions, sometimes surpassing Bitcoin in usage.
   * Stable prices make Litecoin a reliable form of money and is good for payments.
   * High liquidity and widespread exchange support contribute to its adoption.

# Audience Questions

**Question 1**: **2017 Litecoin Sale**

* Stands by the decision to sell his litecoins for decentralization purposes.
* Ensures Litecoin’s long-term viability and independence.
* The community’s mixed reaction is understandable, but he remains committed to Litecoin’s success as his legacy.
* Highlights the fair launch of Litecoin and his belief in the project despite not holding a significant position.

**Question 2**: **New Coins Merged Mining w/ Scrypt (Bells)**

* Supports experimentation with new coins using scrypt mining.
* Merge mining with Litecoin and Dogecoin offers security benefits, allowing new projects to focus on innovation.
* Encourages diversification in mining operations for greater stability and profitability.

","[Litecoin](https://litecoin.org/): the low-fee, near-instant digital asset has seen its hashrate (used to protect transactions and create new blocks on the Litecoin blockchain) surge sharply higher. Data today from Litecoin’s X account shows the hashrate has climbed to over 1.3 quadrillion hashes per second (H/s).

The increase in computational power, in addition to reinforcing the security and reliability of its network, is a sign that miners have increased their confidence in the network. 

Whatever the market price of LTC may be, miners – the demographics of individual and corporate participants contributing their computing resources to uphold the network – are seemingly rallying behind it. This extra activity is important because it makes the network more resistant to attacks while also protecting users and investors.

For example, if I send some LTC to my friend using MWEB, is there ANY possible way for observers to determine that I in fact sent LTC to him? My understanding of Mimblewimble is that when doing these transactions, the sender and recipients' addresses are concealed, along with the amount of LTC sent. 

This made sense to me until I read that using Mimblewimble does not fully anonymize all parties involved and that it should not be used when extreme privacy is needed. I read that it is not as private as using Monero, which confused me, as how much more private can a transaction be without revealing sender/recipient addresses and transaction amount? 

I am asking all of this because as I learn more about crypto privacy I realized all the LTC I have purchased through KYC exchanges does not provide much anonymity.

Its been at least 8 hours since I created the transaction, but its currently still on 'order placed' and 'Waiting for funds to arrive'. I have read it can take a while for a first time buyer through moonpay, but the funds are out of my account, and my bank transfers are instant. Have I been scammed? To add to this, its still on 'pending' as well.#

Edit - It seems like since its a sunday I sent the funds, they won't receive them until tomorrow. Has anyone else experienced this? Unless I rushed through it, it doesn't mention they can't take payments on sundays/weekends. I've made a support ticket but have had no communication from them. Seems like I've been scammed. Why would Cake Wallet have this scam?

I will update this post if it ends up going through, but at this point they seem to be selective scammers. I should have googled them before using, but why would cakewallet use them? I want to die

  
Edit #2 - This was eventually resolved and I got my LTC. Still had no communication through moonpay though, would not recommend using them both for the fees and horrific customer service. ",0.56,1,0,1,litecoin,2024-06-02 14:53:54

I have been experiencing significant challenges for the past two months after access to my Freewallet crypto wallet was suspended. Despite repeatedly fulfilling requirements for documentation and proof of transactions and identity, I still face delays and new demands from Freewallet's support team.

I've expressed frustration over what I consider to be unnecessary and excessive demands from Freewallet, leading me to suspect that they are using tactics to delay or deny releasing my funds. Despite providing extensive documentation, the support team has continuously asked for more information and confirmations. The requirements include:

- 📄 Bank statements showing payments to their partners like Simplex/Moonpay.
- 🛂 Images of my passport and a video recording showing how I access my email.
- 🖼️ A screenshot showing the transactions to Freewallet on the crypto platform I used.
- 📸 A photo of me holding a sign that says ""Freewallet"", along with my driver's license.
- 📑 A recent bank statement or utility bill displaying my name and residential address.
- 📹 Additional identity verification through a video of me holding my ID.
- 📷 They also requested a photo of my driver's license separately and another picture of me holding a piece of paper with ""Freewallet"" written on it, while also holding my mobile showing my Freewallet account.

This ongoing process has been unfolding over the last two months and has caused considerable stress. The last interaction I had was a Skype call where I had both camera and voice on, while they only communicated via messages. They told me that everything was okay and that I just needed to wait. It has now been one week with no response from them.

I demand a swift resolution to regain access to my account. Tagging /u/freewallet_org for immediate assistance.

Yesterday's volume in LTC: 8,500,000+","Bitcoin has seen a significant increase in value over the years, not only as a store of value but also through its widespread transactional use. The growing volume of transactions has driven its price upwards. A similar trend is now observable with Litecoin.

Copium?

* Litecoin is recognized as one of the most widely used cryptocurrencies for transactions, ranking third after Bitcoin and Ethereum in terms of transactional volume. Its fast transaction times and low fees make it a preferred choice for everyday transactions.

* Despite its substantial transactional use, Litecoin's market cap is significantly lower than Bitcoin's and Ethereum's—by hundreds of billions of dollars. This disparity suggests that LTC is undervalued relative to its utility and market presence.

Litecoin appears to be significantly undervalued compared to its peers. The combination of high transactional use, substantial upgrades, and growing adoption points to an upcoming surge in its price as the market begins to recognize its intrinsic value.

BTC accumulated upwards in the same way, solely through sheer use of the network and mass adoption.

But there are also some others, a minority, who care more about having a truly low-cost monetary network that they can use to transfer funds economically with access to privacy and without censorship.

Quite a few start in the first group but end up in the second.

Both goals require usage of Litecoin to increase. If you want these things to happen, besides investing in Litecoin (at whatever level) try to route some of your monthly spend through Litecoin. 

Litecoin will only experience a speculative to-the-moon phase if usage continues to rise. 

We will only have an affordable decentralised uncensorable payment network if we actually use it. 

If you happen to think there is a more decentralised (and widely accessible) project that guarantees uncensored affordable transactions better than Litecoin then run part of your monthly spend through that.

I don't recall what I did back in 2021 and haven't interacted with it since.

I've recently used Compound by supplying 8.6 WETH and borrowing 4000 USDC against it. I understand that by supplying WETH, I should be accruing interest on this supplied asset. However, I'm a bit unsure about where and how I can view the interest accruing on my supplied WETH.

How can I track the interest accruing on my supplied WETH? Is there a specific section on the Compound interface that shows real-time interest accumulation? Does it get transferred to my connected wallet?

* Through the latest integration, Ethereum (ETH) and cbETH can be used as collateral to borrow USDC stablecoin, called USDbC on Base.
* The data shows that currently there is a total of 3.64 million USD (including 2.47 million USD ETH and 1.17 million USD cbETH) being used as collateral, while the amount borrowed is 2.25 million USD. . Lenders receive an annual interest rate (APR) of 1.25%, and users can borrow with an APR of 2.84%.
* Base is layer-2 based on Optimism's OP Stack technology. Base launched its limited mainnet for builders on July 13 and officially opened to the public on August 9. Soon after, the number of users quickly surpassed 100,000 and TVL reached the threshold of 114 million USD, largely thanks to the ""seismic"" social network friend.tech. The daily trading statistics on this layer-2 are also on the verge of surpassing the two seniors Optimism and Arbitrum.
* COMP has had a fairly strong increase in recent times. Do people still hold or sell? Currently, I have sold 40% COMP to convert to RBIF, I bought RBIF to prepare for the big new from Certik. As for the remaining COMP, I will continue to hold

From June 20 to June 30, COMP-related whale transactions skyrocketed by more than 300%.  The IntoTheBlock chart below shows COMP's large transaction volumes jumping from 8 transactions on June 20, to a 1-year high of 67 transactions at the end of June 29.

 Have you accumulated a lot of COMP yet? Currently in my portfolio 60% is COMP and 40% is RBIF

USDT inflows and COMP outflows indicate that this whale has been accumulating steadily.

Currently, do people still hold or have sold COMP? Currently in my portfolio there are only COMP and RBIF. So no matter what, I will continue to hold until the uptrend

Hoping for some experienced answers here as I've recently joined a compounddefi mining pool and all seemed to be going well, with a small investment of 7000 USDT.  Fast forward and I was pledged into a task in which I was told if I deposited 23k, I would receive 3ETH.  I was not able to make any withdrawals during pledge.  I completed this and then was told it's a two stage task and that I would earn another 5 ETH if an additional 20,000 was deposited THEN I am able to access funds.  

I'm feeling I should cut my losses and chalk this up as a learning experience but seek the wisdom of others.

,t3 _ 1e5g5r4,0xPolygon,Polygon Plonky3: the next gen zk proving system,"the next-gen zk proving system has landed—Polygon Plonky3 is production ready and open-source.
already powering Succinct’s SP1 zkVM, Polygon Plonky3 provides super-performant zk-proving while SP1 abstracts away the complexity for devs.

with Polygon Plonky3, devs can more easily extend the cryptographic security provided by ZK by building use-case specific zkVMs and zkEVMs. this flexibility is achieved by providing devs with multiple hash functions and finite fields to choose from, making it possible to optimize for proof-generation time when speed matters or small proofs when size matters.

why build it this way? because the utility of zk proofs for verifiable off-chain computation extends way beyond rollups and L2s, and building new use-cases requires a proving system that is flexible and can grow alongside the mathematical innovation of the field

and it goes without saying: the modular zk proving system is open-source licensed under MIT/Apache and has been extensively audited for soundness.

,t3 _ 1dz5eto,0xPolygon,"TON Blockchain Will Release New Layer-2 Based On Polygon’s Technology -
The new protocol, called the TON Applications Chain (TAC), will make use of Polygon’s Chain Development Kit (CDK), as well as their AggLayer.","The team behind The Open Network (TON), the popular blockchain that taps into the Telegram messaging platform, said that it is coming out with its own layer-2 network based on Polygon’s technology. The team made the announcement on Tuesday at the Ethereum Community Conference (EthCC) in Brussels, Belgium.

The new protocol, called the TON Applications Chain (TAC), will make use of Polygon’s Chain Development Kit (CDK), a customizable toolkit that lets developers create their own layer-2 blockchains based off of Polygon’s zero-knowledge technology, as well as Polygon’s AggLayer, their interoperability layer for solving blockchain fragmentation.

According to a press release shared with CoinDesk, TAC is “designed to enable EVM-based decentralized applications to TON’s ecosystem” while also allowing Ethereum developers to build new programs for Telegram’s users.

“TAC is set to significantly enhance liquidity access and accelerate DeFi adoption for the TON ecosystem,” the TON team wrote in the press release. “Beyond DeFi, TAC will pave the way for a wide range of innovative applications on the TON blockchain, such as gaming, and decentralized identity solutions.”

The news comes as other major blockchain companies have pursued their own layer-2 networks over the past year. In August, cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase launched its “Base” blockchain with Optimism’s OP Stack, kicking off the trend. Since then, protocols like Celo and Worldcoin have shared their plans to launch layer-2 rollups with OP Stack, and cryptocurrency exchange OKX also released a layer-2 in April called “X Layer” with Polygon’s CDK.

“We chose to build on the Polygon ecosystem for its EVM compatibility, AggLayer's EVM liquidity bridging, comprehensive deployment support, and Polygon's EVM expertise,” said Pavel Altukhov, the founder of TAC, to CoinDesk over email. “The vibrant community surrounding Polygon was also a crucial factor in our decision.”

,t3 _ 1dv0svv,0xPolygon,Pending smart contract interaction for more than 12 hours,"Last night I was trying to do a swap but the swap didn't go through and I have been stuck with pending smart contract interaction since then. This is what I've tried that hasn't worked so far:

1. speed up
2. cancel
3. sending 0 matic to myself with same transaction nonce and higher fee
4. resetting my metamask wallet (because I can't see my pending transaction on Polygon scan)

None of these have fixed it. When I resetted my metamask wallet it tells me ""failed"" under the new transaction I tried to send. When I import metamask on a different browser and I try to build a new transaction it picks the same nonce as the stuck transaction (which makes me think the stuck transaction was never broadcasted anywhere, but then why will new transactions fail?).

  
Any idea how to fix this?",1.0,5,0,5,Polygon,2024-07-04 07:11:50
,t3 _ 1duv0cm,0xPolygon,DePIN is taking off on Polygon: GEODNet,"**Continuing my DePin blitz on Polygon, today I want to highlight a project that has been getting a good amount of attention, and with GREAT reason: GEODNet!**

GEODNet stands for Global Earth Observation Decentralized Network.  
  
**Let's dive in:**

---------------------

  
**&gt;&gt; GEODNet: Revolutionizing Real-Time Geospatial Data with DePin and Polygon &lt;&lt;**  
  
In the realm of Web3, decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePin) are rapidly transforming how we interact with our world   
  
One groundbreaking project that deserves more attention is GEODNet, which stands for Global Earth Observation Decentralized Network.  
  
GEODNet, a pioneering initiative in the GPS industry, leverages the principles of DePin to create a robust, reliable Real-Time Kinematics (RTK) network.  
  
Built on Polygon's robust and scalable blockchain infrastructure, GEODNet aims to provide unparalleled accuracy in real-time positioning data, which has the ability to reshape numerous industries, enhancing the human experience.  


---------------------

**1. What is GEODNet?**  
  
GEODNet is a blockchain-based RTK network that utilizes a decentralized network of GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite Systems) reference stations. GEODNet refers to these stations as ""Base Stations"" or ""Satellite Miners"".  
  
These stations form a global network designed to provide **\*\******centimeter-level accuracy\*\**** in positioning data. Pretty crazy when you consider how inaccurate our current GPS systems seem to be. For instance, my iPhone currently says that I am in a different room of my house!  
  
The GEODNet team envisions a future where 100,000 Base Stations cover the Earth's land surface, creating a network 20 times larger than any existing network, specifically the Continuously Operated Reference Station (CORS) network.

  
---------------------  
**2. Why GEODNet is an absolute game changer  for humanity?**  
  
Traditional GPS systems, while still very effective, often suffer from accuracy issues with errors ranging from a few meters to several dozen meters (see my iPhone anecdote earlier).  
  
GEODNet addresses this by deploying Base Stations  on rooftops worldwide, acting as nodes that provide real-time correction data.  
  
This process, termed ""correction streaming,"" allows devices within 12.5 miles, or about 20 km, of a Base Station to achieve insanely precise, centimeter-level position accuracy.   
  
&gt;&gt;Yes you read that right. 12.5 miles! Insanity &lt;&lt;

  
This level of precision has profound implications for numerous sectors, showing GEODNet's potential to have a real world impact:  
  
- Smartphones and Consumer Applications: Enhanced mapping and navigation services.  
  
- Autonomous Vehicles: Improved safety and efficiency on roads.  
  
- Agriculture: Precise farming operations, particularly pertinent for a future involving farming drones, in addition to resource management.  
  
- Construction and Transportation: Accurate positioning for large-scale projects.  
  
- Civil Resource Management: Location services to enable higher efficiencies for emergency response teams such as police, search &amp; rescue, and fire departments.  
  
Participants who install and maintain these Base Stations are rewarded with [$GEOD](https://x.com/search?q=%24GEOD&amp;src=cashtag_click) tokens, the utility token of the GEODNet network.   
  
These tokens can be used in a variety of ways, such as paying for RTK data services, participating in GEODNet governance, trading on decentralized exchanges like QuickSwap and UniSwap, and more.

  
---------------------  
**3. GEODNet Location NFTs and Network Coverage**  
  
One challenge all DePin projects face is ensuring even and growing network coverage, especially in hard to reach places such as rural areas.  
  
GEODNet addresses this with what they call Location NFTs, which are unique tokens on Polygon that incentivize geographical deployment distribution.  
  
By using hexagons (also called Hexes) to map coverage areas, GEODNet maximizes precision and proximity, ensuring a network efficiency, stability, and overall usability.  
  
Base Station operators can earn Location NFTs by meeting specific criteria, ensuring their stations provide reliable data.

  
---------------------  
**4. How to Get Involved**  
  
To participate in GEODNet, individuals can purchase a certified GNSS antenna (a Base Station) from approved vendors. I have posted a picture below from the GEODNet documentation that includes the approved vendors.  
  
Once installed and connected to the internet (see the GEODNet documentation for assistance), these Base Stations begin sending data to GEODNet's cloud platform, earning [$GEOD](https://x.com/search?q=%24GEOD&amp;src=cashtag_click) tokens in the process.  
  
The mining process is extremely straightforward, making it accessible to a broad audience. This is key in helping the network grow, and in ensuring that anybody can participate.   
  
*You've gotta love this approach!*   
  
Ensuring simplicity is paramount.  


---------------------

**5. Future Prospects and Broader Impact**  
  
GEODNet's decentralized approach to geospatial data has far-reaching implications.  
  
For Web3 projects, it offers a scalable, reliable, decentralized, censorship resistant infrastructure for precise location services, fostering innovation in autonomous systems, smart cities, and beyond.  
  
Web2 companies can also leverage this network to enhance their location-based services, driving efficiency and user satisfaction.  
  
**6. Why build on Polygon?**  
  
Choosing to build on Polygon underscores GEODNet's commitment to leveraging cutting-edge blockchain technology for optimal performance and scalability.  
  
Polygon offers a stable, battle-tested, and efficient infrastructure that is perfectly suited for handling the high data throughput and transaction volume required by a global network like GEODNet.  
  
Moreover, Polygon's commitment to security and decentralization aligns with GEODNet's mission to create a reliable and accessible RTK network.  
  
***&gt;&gt; No wonder so many DePin projects are building here&lt;&lt;***  
  
Projects like GEODNet, which adopt a decentralized approach to building high-quality infrastructure, are pivotal in driving the evolution of humanity in our increasingly digital world.  
  
By decentralizing the provision of precise geospatial data, GEODNet empowers communities, enhances technological innovation, and fosters greater inclusivity.  
  
As we move towards a more connected future, decentralized projects like GEODNet will become increasingly essential in laying the foundation for a truly equitable and efficient digital ecosystem.  
  
Thank you for your time, and I hope you enjoyed my exploration of GEODNet.  
  
 Let me know if there are some projects in the RWI (real world impact) space that you would like to read more about!   
  
Have a great day

,t3 _ 1due5ls,0xPolygon,Background Story on Sentient - As told by Sandeep,"Some time ago, I had [u/sreeramkannan](https://x.com/sreeramkannan) at my house in Dubai. We were discussing my ideas about how crypto can fix AI's centralization and safety issues and how [@0xPolygon](https://x.com/0xPolygon) can play a role in shaping this tectonic shift for humanity.  
  
I told him (requesting him not to make fun of me for being an AI novice) but what if AI models had loyalty to their creator communities? He didn't laugh. Instead, he asked a lot of questions and I explained to him my thought process. At the end he was like, OH OH OH, this could be huge.   
  
He shared this problem statement with Princeton Professor [@viswanathpramod](https://x.com/viswanathpramod) (who is the co-inventor of Flash OFDM, the technology behind 4G wireless standard) and IISC Professor [@hstyagi](https://x.com/hstyagi), who had been researching something similar already. Pramod said that this problem statement could give rise to a whole new branch in AI + cryptography research and called it AI native cryptography.   
  
That research became [@sentient\_agi](https://x.com/sentient_agi). It will be built on [@0xPolygon](https://x.com/0xPolygon) Agglayer, and I will be helping them as a core contributor. This project is extremely ambitious and with model loyalty, it is trying to solve a problem that has never been approached from this direction. With this fundraise, Sentient already has some of the world's best AI minds joining it, and the AI team is getting pretty stacked with senior people from Google, Deepmind, and other top AI companies in the world engaged.   
  
If successful, Sentient could potentially change the course of humanity's relationship with AI. Let's try to build and see how it goes.

,t3 _ 1du5h82,0xPolygon,Sentiment AGI - with $85M seed round - to build on Polygon,"🚨 Huge AI news alert! 

Sentient an AI platform that will be built on @0xPolygon protocols, secured a *HUGE* $85M seed round led by Peter Thiel's Founders Fund, co-led by Pantera Capital and Framework Ventured. 

Let’s dive in:

This project is going to democratize development and break the monopoly of tech giants like Google and Meta 👏

Sentient's platform will leverage Polygon's scalability, including The AggLayer (confirmed), and likely the Polygon CDK - expanding the Ethereum’s and blockchain’s impression on the AI industry. 

@sandeepnailwal , Polygon co-founder, is a key contributor with landmark ideas that differentiate this project from the thousands of other AI/blockchain ideas:

➡️ “What if AI models had loyalty to their creator communities?” 🤔

As previously mentioned,an additional core value of this project is to democratize AI - 

Which is currently dominated by giants of the tech industry such as Google, Meta, and now OpenAI.

Sandeep notes, ""We're building an open platform for AGI development to ensure AI benefits are equitably distributed."" 

➡️ Sentient's mission is to align AI development with humanity's interests, rather than novelty and profit. 

Entering the testnet phase this year (this quarter), Sentient plans to deploy its funds to develop its platform and attract top talent in AI research and blockchain engineering. 

Sandeep notes “Sentient already has some of the world’s best AI minds joining it, and the AI team is […] stacked with senior people from Google, have a good day Deepmind, and other top AI companies in the world engaged”.

Stay tuned, as this project is sure to have a significant impact on the human-tech interface, where AI is quickly positioning itself as a catalyst. 

💪Blockchain and AI are converging. 

💪The Ethereum and Polygon ecosystems are preparing for the convergence, leading the way with forward thinkers and initiative.

After Reddit sunset their RCP and Moons, the web3 engagement on Reddit has been relatively low. [u/RickRibera93](https://www.reddit.com/user/RickRibera93/), a moderator here, [r/ConeHeads](https://www.reddit.com/r/ConeHeads/), and creator of [u/CommunityCurrencyBot](https://www.reddit.com/user/CommunityCurrencyBot/) has continually developed his application to help monetize content and empower communities on Reddit.

,t3 _ 1dsc8z8,0xPolygon,Polymarket: The Numbers and an Unexpected Outcome,"For those not familiar, Polymarket is a prediction market for real world events - sports, politics, you name it.  
  
Right now, U.S. politics are sending usage rates to the moon   
  
Let's dive into Polymarket's huge takeoff 🔥  
  
Is Polymarket's approach the recipe for Web3's success? I sure think so!

  
-------------

  
**June 2024 has seen Polymarket's highest monthly volume and monthly active trader count.** ***EVER*****.**   
  
And it's not close, nearly doubling the previous high.  
  
This has been primarily driven by the first U.S. Presidential Debate, in addition to UEFA Euro 2024.

  
Polymarket's monthly volume (as of today) for June 2024 is up to about $110 M!! With monthly active traders up to nearly 30K. 

**Both of these numbers have nearly double ATHs, set** ***just last month*****.**

  
-------------

The first 2024 U.S. Presidential Debate took place on June 27th, 2024.  
  
The following day, daily volume went through the roof, reaching $10.69 M.   
  
***The month of June also saw Polymarket double its record for monthly new accounts, set just last month.***

-------------

An unexpected outcome of Polymarket's usage:   
  
It is now frequently looked to as a more meaningful polling mechanism within the U.S.  
  
Why?  
  
**SKIN IN THE GAME. Lack of bias.**

  
-------------

Polls in the U.S. have lost the trust of the public.   
  
Why?   
  
Small sample sizes, outdated data acquisition techniques, geo-locked polling, and bias that is inherent to the organizations polling the public.  
  
***Who would have thought a betting market could be the answer?!***

Definitely not something I would have consider. An incredible emergent property in my opinion!

-------------

**One of the coolest parts about Polymarket's approach?**   
  
*Polymarket uses Polygon's public blockchain infrastructure to provide its services, and the majority of its users have no idea.*   
  
Is this what adoption of blockchain tech looks like?   
  
Will Polymarket continue to see this meteoric rise in usage surrounding global events?  
  
Only time will tell!

-------------

I'll be making an effort to get back in this sub, which was really the birthplace of my real interest in this space. Good things are ahead here!

Also, if you want to follow me on X, I'd greatly appreciate the support!

,t3 _ 1dqhltm,0xPolygon,Brief recap of everything Polygon is doing,"What's cooking lately over at Polygon?

If you haven't been following, you're missing out.

Plenty of exciting news and updates, day by day.

Massive partnerships and integrations.

Groundbreaking innovation taking place.

Plus, Polygon is being utilised across many major sectors and hitting on trending key narratives: RWA, DePIN, NFTs, DeFi, gaming - you name it.

The purple army is growing at lightspeed.

Here are a few recent key initiatives, developments, and stats across the Polygon ecosystem:

• Polygon recently announced their 1,000,000,000 $POL Community Grants Program to support projects and builders within the ecosystem

• Aragon Project is creating a governance hub for Polygon that will serve as a unified and seamless experience to engage the entire community

• The AggLayer continues to be a hot topic, bringing ecosystems and communities closer together through unified liquidity and more. Learn about it on The Aggregated 𝕏 spaces, every Friday!

• Polygon PoS hit a new ATH this month in active wallet addresses, reaching 1.6+ million

• 440+ million unique addresses are on Polygon PoS, up ~12% since January 2024 

• This month, Polygon PoS monthly active users overtook Ethereum L1 in usage - a huge milestone

• The market cap of stablecoins on Polygon is about to hit $1.8 billion. Adoption is growing faster than ever, with a push to drive more native $USDC usage and liquidity

And so much more. Polygon has it all and continues to be a dominant blockchain force. 

The Goons are about to melt faces 👿

Of course, QuickSwap and the dragon army are continuing their mission to keep driving adoption on Polygon through the roof. With nearly $13 billion in trading volume throughout 2024 alone, new innovative products like the Falkor perps DEX on PoS, launching on Polygon CDK chains, and more, things are just getting started.

Come ride the purple wave.

,t3 _ 1do9mx7,0xPolygon,"Update: Fox Corporation to Upgrade Verify Beta to Dedicated L2 Built with Polygon CDK, Announces TIME as First Publishing Partner","# First launched as a protocol on Polygon PoS, Fox will use Polygon CDK to build Verify, an open protocol for content attestation. TIME will be the first external media company to utilize Verify.

tl;dr:

* Update: Fox Corporation is transitioning the beta version of Verify to an independent zero-knowledge (ZK) blockchain using Polygon CDK, making it the first enterprise to launch a ZK-powered Ethereum L2
* TIME will be the first external media company to leverage the Verify protocol for content licensing and verification.
* Verify is developed by Fox Corporation’s Emerging Technology team in conjunction with implementation provider Gelato
* More than 106k articles and 300k pieces of content have been registered on the beta version, built on Polygon PoS
* End consumers will be able to verify the origin of content registered by media companies through the open protocol, as demonstrated on the beta app, [verify.fox](http://verify.fox)
* The Verify team will release open source smart contracts, enabling publishers of all sizes to license their content to AI companies

Today, Fox Corporation has announced an update: The beta version of [Verify](https://www.verifymedia.com/), an open source protocol to prove the origin of registered media, is transitioning to a dedicated zero-knowledge (ZK) blockchain using Polygon CDK, with [Gelato](https://www.gelato.network/) as an implementation provider. Additionally, TIME, a global media brand, has been announced as the first publishing partner to leverage the Verify protocol for content licensing and verification. 

Fox Corp will use the ZK technology and infrastructure pioneered at Polygon Labs to transition Verify into a dedicated ZK chain focused on transparently proving the authenticity of registered content. With Verify, readers can check whether an article or image purportedly from a publisher in fact originated at the source using the beta app, [verify.fox](http://verify.fox), so long as the media is registered.

TIME will be the first external partner to leverage the Verify and register pieces of content on the dedicated, Polygon CDK-deployed chain. 

Leveraging Verify helps publishers like TIME establish a technical, cryptographic bridge to AI platforms. With its Verified Access Point, publishers access new commercial opportunities by utilizing smart contracts that set programmatic conditions for access to content. So as AI-generated text and images flow more widely online, Verify will be able to help consumers not only identify the veritable source of content, but also give media publishers more control over relationships with AI platforms scraping the web. 

This announcement demonstrates the exciting design space that’s opened up when the future of media is indexed onchain. 

Publishers like TIME will register individual pieces of content that are cryptographically signed onchain. Consumers then can verify content from trusted sources using the Verify Tool. 

In short, content can be proved at its source. 

Fox Corp launched a closed beta of Verify in August of 2023. Now, more than 300k pieces of content have been signed to Verify from a wide-variety of Fox-related brands, including Fox News, Fox Business, Fox Sports, and Fox TV affiliates. 

TIME joins as the first external publisher. 

The transition to a ZK chain is important for adoption. With a dedicated ZK chain, Verify upgrades to increased capacity for content that can be registered onchain. Verify will not have to compete for precious resources on Polygon PoS, but instead dedicate computation specifically to content attestation and provenance. 

The Verify protocol is open source, with developers and users invited to contribute or fork [the source code](https://github.com/verify-media). Verify was originally developed in-house by the Fox Emerging Technology team, but will lean on Gelato to implement a dedicated chain with Polygon CDK. 

In the future, Verify will also have the option to connect to the AggLayer and joain a horizontally scalable web of interoperable chains for seamless cross-chain message passing. Current chains connected to the AggLayer include OKX’s recently launched X Layer, Astar zkEVM, and Polygon zkEVM.

,t3 _ 1djitxd,0xPolygon,Ronin is building a zk L2 with Polygon CDK!,"From Ronin's blog post- [https://roninchain.com/blog/posts/introducing-ronin-zkevm](https://roninchain.com/blog/posts/introducing-ronin-zkevm)

**Key Points**

* We’re thrilled to outline our plans to enable zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machines (zkEVM) on Ronin! This would allow builders to launch their own Layer 2 chains on top of the Ronin mainnet, while opening the door to faster and more accessible gaming experiences on Ronin. **More games, smoother transactions.**
* Ronin builders will soon be able to leverage the Polygon Chain Development Kit (CDK) to create their own zkEVM chains on Ronin.
* This is a big step towards Ronin’s infinite scalability and a permissionless ecosystem. If you’re interested in exploring our thinking on a more technical level, check out the latest Whitepaper [here.](https://docs.roninchain.com/basics/white-paper?ref=roninchain.ghost.io)

*This is a moment we’ve been looking forward to for years.* 

In 2018, five founders joined forces in a cramped Vietnamese office to build Axie Infinity. They shared a vision of ownership-infused blockchain games, and that vision would go on to catalyze the birth of an industry.

Years later, Ronin’s launch marked the birth of a blockchain optimized for gaming and enabled Axie to take the world by storm. 

Last year, Ronin upgraded to DPOS and paved the way for the next generation of web3 games to deploy on Ronin.

Today, we begin yet another chapter in our journey…

**The time has come to scale Ronin with zkEVM.**

# Introducing zkEVM on Ronin

At 1.5M daily active users (DAA), Ronin is the largest gaming blockchain in the world. We’ve done this because of our focus on onboarding real users, real gamers. Real people.

The next step in our journey builds on this core DNA, and leverages the Polygon Chain Development Kit (CDK) to continue forging ahead on our mission. 

In the future, game developers will have the ability to launch their own Layer 2 blockchains on top of Ronin mainnet. These new Ronin chains will use zero-knowledge proofs to open the door to more games, more players, and more economic freedom.

The introduction of zkEVM will also align incentives between Ronin Layer 2 chains and Ronin’s mainnet. For example, developers will need to meet the 250K RON requirement to run a Ronin validator before launching their chain – and this economic activity on the L2s can even increase staking rewards for delegators. **Shared security, shared rewards.** This means Ronin’s scalability, security, and decentralization will improve together.

# What is zkEVM?

**zkEVM allows a blockchain to process more transactions without revealing transaction data.** Think of it like this: 

James is the only person who knows the location of a hidden treasure. If he reveals the treasure’s location to another person, they might claim it for themselves! So, James keeps the location secret. One day, a friend asks James for proof that the treasure is real. How can James prove that he knows the treasure’s location without revealing its exact location to the friend? James can use zero-knowledge proofs. Here’s how:

*James can take a picture of himself with the treasure, and show that picture to his friend.*

In this example, James can prove his *knowledge* of the treasure’s location without *revealing* its exact location. In the context of blockchains, zero-knowledge proofs allow validators to prove their knowledge of transactions without revealing the underlying data. This reduces the blockspace required and preserves privacy. As a result, the blockchain can process transactions with greater efficiency. That means faster and less expensive transactions from transfers to swaps to smart contract interactions and more.

Today, Ronin can handle up to \~40 million transactions per day. What would it take to make that number 400 million, or even 4 billion? zkEVM is the answer. Imagine the Ronin mainnet as it exists today, then picture an infinite web of chains on top. That’s how zkEVMs will help scale Ronin.

While Ronin has comfortably supported existing games in the ecosystem with low gas costs, our exponential growth means we need to stay 5 steps ahead when it comes to scalability. Certain games, such as fully-onchain-games, have specific needs and may even want to put a majority of game actions on-chain. In the past, it’s been difficult for these types of games to onboard to Ronin because of their potential to clog up Ronin with transactions.

The term zkEVM is a combination of two ideas: zero-knowledge proofs and Ethereum Virtual Machines. Zero-knowledge proofs are a method to verify the validity of some blockchain transactions, and Ethereum Virtual Machines are blockchains that use existing Ethereum infrastructure. If you’re interested in a more technical deep dive, read the latest Whitepaper [here.](https://docs.roninchain.com/basics/white-paper?ref=roninchain.ghost.io)

# What This Means for the Ronin Movement

If everything goes according to plan, the first zkEVM chains may launch sometime in Q1 2025. At that time, builders will have the opportunity to make their own blockchains on top of Ronin. That means you might see a Pixels chain, an Apeiron chain, or even a Ragnarok chain! These game-specific chains will give builders stronger tools to create ownership-fueled experiences in their gaming universe. **More chains, more games.** However, these opportunities also bestow new responsibilities onto users.

Today, the Ronin ecosystem has a handful of live games. In a year from now, the implementation of zkEVMs will bring more builders to our ecosystem. These builders will be able to design games, dApps &amp; tokens, and entire ecosystems! You’ll be able to transfer, swap tokens, and trade NFTs across any of these chains – and must also accept the responsibility of doing your own careful research, as users will remain 100% responsible for their on-chain actions.

Here’s a quick summary of the benefits of zkEVM. Screenshot this for reference.

* **Scalability**
   * zkEVM enables infinite blockspace by enabling economically aligned layer 2 chains to be deployed on top of Ronin
   * Eventually Ronin is exploring Agglayer to turn itself into a L2, leading to Ethereum alignment
* **User experience**
   * Seamless cross-chain experience that allows users to seamlessly tap into applications like Mavis Market and Katana from a zkEVM chain
* **Economic Alignment**
   * Potentially higher staking rewards since the L2 sequencer fees go to the validator running the L2 chain
   * Starting a zkEVM chain requires 250,000 RON, potentially increasing demand and utility for RON
* **More games**
   * Allows onboarding of game teams with technical needs that require them to run their own distinct chain
   * Permissionless deployment. Anyone will be able to deploy their games to Ronin, allowing for more competition and faster onboarding

Ronin developers are excited to experiment alongside the community. For example, we’re looking forward to exploring Polygon’s AggLayer as it becomes more refined. The AggLayer combines both modular and monolithic approaches to blockchain scaling.

# Founders’ Thoughts

So far, a smaller number of promising games have onboarded onto Ronin. This was needed in the beginning and part of what allowed us to catalyze the first two web3 games to hit 1M DAU.

But the time to take off the weights is approaching. In order to reach our true potential, we need to drive towards faster, permissionless games onboarding.

Blockchains have the potential to create economic freedom for every user of the internet. This was crypto’s original promise but for too long, the crypto industry has been dominated by infrastructure projects that prioritize technical innovation without a clear strategy for distribution and user adoption. 

Ronin is different. We’ve actually onboarded millions of everyday people via games. 

17 million of these gamers now have crypto wallets with a majority using Defi and transferring crypto for the first time on Ronin.

This victory stems from our unique strategy:

Initially, Ronin was developed to meet the needs of a single game and its community– Axie. This focused approach allowed us to dominate and excel in a niche which helped us bootstrap a core community that fueled our expansion into larger markets.

This mirrors the approach of the early days at Amazon, which began by selling books before diversifying its offerings, and Apple, which started with personal computers and gradually broadened its product lines. Similarly, Nintendo’s initial go-to-market (GTM) strategy for their hardware revolved around the iconic Mario franchise, ensuring a strong foundation before building even more devices and publishing a larger variety of games.

Similarly, zkEVM will help Ronin to expand its scope beyond servicing a smaller number of quality games to becoming the backbone of the entire web3 gaming industry. Every great web3 game that’s ever created should be on Ronin. With zkEVM, this future is now within reach.

*While this tech upgrade is exciting we want to remind the world that in web3, community is your moat and technology is only as powerful as the people that actually use it.*

# Final Thoughts

zkEVM and the Polygon CDK are now part of the Ronin arsenal. However, there’s still a long road ahead before gamers will taste the fruits of the seeds planted today. That’s why we’ll continue to double-down on our community and distribution as key differentiators. More games are coming soon, and zkEVM is just the beginning of a more scalable, permissionless Ronin. Ronin has risen – let’s keep pushing.

**vKey Points**

* We’re thrilled to outline our plans to enable zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machines (zkEVM) on Ronin! This would allow builders to launch their own Layer 2 chains on top of the Ronin mainnet, while opening the door to faster and more accessible gaming experiences on Ronin. **More games, smoother transactions.**
* Ronin builders will soon be able to leverage the Polygon Chain Development Kit (CDK) to create their own zkEVM chains on Ronin.
* This is a big step towards Ronin’s infinite scalability and a permissionless ecosystem. If you’re interested in exploring our thinking on a more technical level, check out the latest Whitepaper [here.](https://docs.roninchain.com/basics/white-paper?ref=roninchain.ghost.io)

*This is a moment we’ve been looking forward to for years.* 

In 2018, five founders joined forces in a cramped Vietnamese office to build Axie Infinity. They shared a vision of ownership-infused blockchain games, and that vision would go on to catalyze the birth of an industry.

Years later, Ronin’s launch marked the birth of a blockchain optimized for gaming and enabled Axie to take the world by storm. 

Last year, Ronin upgraded to DPOS and paved the way for the next generation of web3 games to deploy on Ronin.

Today, we begin yet another chapter in our journey…

**The time has come to scale Ronin with zkEVM.**

# Introducing zkEVM on Ronin

At 1.5M daily active users (DAA), Ronin is the largest gaming blockchain in the world. We’ve done this because of our focus on onboarding real users, real gamers. Real people.

The next step in our journey builds on this core DNA, and leverages the Polygon Chain Development Kit (CDK) to continue forging ahead on our mission. 

In the future, game developers will have the ability to launch their own Layer 2 blockchains on top of Ronin mainnet. These new Ronin chains will use zero-knowledge proofs to open the door to more games, more players, and more economic freedom.

The introduction of zkEVM will also align incentives between Ronin Layer 2 chains and Ronin’s mainnet. For example, developers will need to meet the 250K RON requirement to run a Ronin validator before launching their chain – and this economic activity on the L2s can even increase staking rewards for delegators. **Shared security, shared rewards.** This means Ronin’s scalability, security, and decentralization will improve together.",0.94,16,0,16,Polygon,2024-06-19 13:11:38

,t3 _ 1di2l5s,0xPolygon,"Kicking Off the Polygon Governance Hub, a Unified and Transparent Interface for Community Governance
","# Built in the open, hand-in-hand with the community: The Polygon Governance Hub, developed with Aragon, lets users and builders influence core development of Polygon technology and infuse it with the community’s values.

**tl;dr**

* Polygon Gov Hub, built with Aragon, will be a full-stack governance solution and user interface for the community 
* The initial version of the Hub will focus on two of the three pillars of Polygon Governance – Protocol Governance and System Smart Contracts (SSC) Governance
* Builders and members of the community can propose Polygon Improvement Proposals (PIPs), both for protocol and system smart contract upgrades
* For SSC governance, the Protocol Council will publish transparency reports for every PIP, explaining their decision and initiating the voting period
* Token holders will be able to vote on the Protocol Council’s decision, as long as the tokens are staked, or delegate votes to community delegates who represent their interest

# Today marks an important continuation in a journey that will increase community ownership: Introducing the Polygon Governance Hub. 

Over the past year, the Polygon community has helped to define a framework of decentralized, community-led governance for Polygon, focusing on three main pillars, i.e. aspects of governance:

* Protocol Governance
* System Smart Contract (SSC) Governance
* Community Treasury Governance 

Protocol Governance facilitates upgrades of Polygon protocols via the PIP framework and ecosystem consensus, in a process comparable to Ethereum protocol governance. System Smart Contract (SSC) Governance facilitates upgrades of L1 smart contracts that are necessary for Polygon protocols to operate. These upgrades leverage the PIP framework, as well as the Polygon Protocol Council—a community-controlled body introduced last October as a critical first step towards a scalable, secure, and decentralized governance. 

The Polygon Gov Hub will be a unified governance interface and a center of community decision-making. For Protocol Governance, it increases transparency and participation. For SSC Governance, it enables staker voting, and a delegate program—a framework which will give the community oversight over key protocol development.

Community-member voting exists for those who are working to secure the network. Token holders can vote as long as the voting tokens are staked. Alternatively, they may choose to assign voting power to community delegates who represent their interest. This system will provide alignment throughout the community, as well as key oversight and checks on the decision-making of the Polygon Protocol Council. 

Governance should be transparent and accessible. Over the next few months, various aspects of the Polygon Governance Hub are proposed to be phased in. At each step of the development process, the community can give iterative feedback and inject the Polygon Governance Hub with fresh ideas. The Hub will be built in phases by Aragon, a leader in the DAO tooling space.

In its end state, the Polygon Gov Hub will be a transparent interface for all decision-making across Polygon system smart contracts, designed for activities ranging from knowledge gathering to voting. 

Let’s dive in.

# Breaking down the Polygon Governance Hub

The Polygon Governance Hub will be a full-stack governance solution. It’s an iterative, innovative experiment to make decentralized governance more efficient, while also retaining robust protocol security.

For Protocol Governance, the framework remains as is; the Gov Hub will aggregate all submitted PIPs and follow their progress, increasing transparency and participation.

For SSC Governance, here’s a brief overview of the framework introduced in this initial version, followed by a breakdown.

Let’s break down what the Polygon Gov Hub enables, and a typical procedural flow for new governance proposals:

1. **A PIP is proposed.** The Hub will be an accessible, collaborative space for users, builders, and the community at large to learn and contribute. After a Polygon Improvement Proposal ([PIP](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/how-to-write-and-submit-polygon-improvement-proposals-pips/11472)) has been submitted to the PIP repo and extensively peer-reviewed, as well as discussed on the Polygon Protocol Governance Call, the next step will be for it to be voted on by the Polygon Protocol Council;
2. **The 13-member Protocol Council (PC) votes**. With a focus on simplicity and transparency, the community will be able to see how the Council votes on proposed protocol upgrades. Regular proposals will require 7/13 PC consensus and be subject to a 10-day timelock. Emergency proposals will require a 10/13 supermajority—this bypasses the 10-day timelock in the case of severe system risk.
3. **A transparency report is issued**. After every vote, whether or not a PIP passed with consensus through the Council, the Gov Hub will feature a transparency report, as well as provide guidelines, member lists, and dashboards for onchain activities. 
4. **A 10-day voting window opens for community participants to signal approval or veto of the PIP**. Delegates and staked tokenholders in Polygon Proof-of-Stake contracts will be able to easily participate in governance through the user interface. During the 10-day timelock window, they will be able to signal a veto of the PC vote, putting in place vital checks and balances.

Aragon, a long standing contributor to the Polygon community, will be building the Polygon Governance Hub using Aragon OSx, a new generation of governance tooling that makes it easy to build custom onchain governance solutions and adapt them over time with a modular plugin-based architecture.

The adaptability of the governance framework, along with an accessible UI to encourage wide community participation, will enable future-proof, community-led, and iterative governance.

Over time, the phased-in approach will give the Polygon community the opportunity to help iterate not only on the Polygon Governance Hub, but also the direction of all aspects of the protocol itself. 

# Why is this needed? 

The Polygon Governance Hub will be specifically adapted to current and changing needs of the Polygon community. 

The Hub will be optimized to evolve over time—with community feedback.

Polygon, and all related network architecture, needs flexible, transparent, and future-proof governance mechanisms and tooling. The Polygon Governance Hub is central to achieving this. 

Aragon will be rolling out the first features of the Polygon Governance Hub in the next couple of months. This is part of the community’s commitment to building in public and incorporating community feedback.

The future of Web3 is aggregated.

,t3 _ 1dhu63b,0xPolygon,Is perps trading on DeFi protocols worth it? CEXs vs DEXs.,"Personally, I've only traded for short-term profits on CEXs. When it comes to swapping, then I'm comfortable doing it on a DEX more than on a CEX - just because I don't hold tokens on CEXs, but on my own wallet. One less extra step and more secure with self-custody.

When it comes to perps trading, that's another completely different story. Trades get through faster and the whole UI /UX gives me more peace of mind. With that said, protocols such as Decentralized Perpetuals Exchanges on large chains such as Ethereum, Polygon or Arbitrum have become very popular lately.

That made me open my mind and try some of these Perpetuals Exchanges. The reason I used decentralised perps DEXs instead of centralised perps trading is because it’s just easier with the UI/UX and much faster (plus generally cheaper with borrowing fees). 

Here are some of the most worthy ones by chain, in my opinion. It's a personal and non-exhaustive list, so feel free to add more in the comments!

**- Ethereum:** dYdX  
**- Arbitrum:** GMX  
**- Polygon:** QuickPerps Falkor  
**- Solana:** Jupiter  
**- Optimism:** Aevo  
**- Base:** Synthetix  
**- Kava:** Kinetix

Most of my activity occurs on Polygon as that's what I got comfortable with. We've all got our chains that we use more than others. That's where I stay but other chains/perpetuals listed above have a lot going for them and perfectly mimic the CEX trading experience.

I've tried a bunch of Decentralized Perpetuals Exchanges and the ones listed above have met my requirements of UI/UX the best. As mentioned before, I might have missed some of the better ones out there. That's why I want to hear from you in the comments below.",1.0,5,0,5,Polygon,2024-06-17 09:41:15

Layer-2 network Polygon is starting a Community Grants Program to encourage builders to build in its ecosystem, Polygon Labs said on Tuesday. The program aims to place 1 billion POL, Polygon’s soon-to-rebrand MATIC token, into the hands of developers over the next 10 years.
The program went live Tuesday with 35 million tokens, worth $23 million at current prices, eligible for distribution. The network is in the process of transitioning its current token, MATIC, to the new POL ticker, so this first tranche of tokens will be denominated in MATIC.

The program will tap into funds made available by Polygon’s Community Treasury, and the team shared that roughly 100 million POL tokens will be given out each year.

Those looking to participate in the program can opt into two tracks. The first is what the team calls a “General Grant Track,” which is for builders looking to build anything on Polygon. The second is the “Consumer Crypto Track,” which focuses on projects that drive crypto adoption, including gaming, decentralized social applications, AI and blockchain integrations, and NFT innovations.
“The grant program follows proposals to ensure that Polygon becomes a strong, community-governed aggregated network of chains,” Polygon wrote in a blog post.

,t3 _ 1dak0up,0xPolygon,Wen Markets Token Launchpad is Live!,"[Wen.Markets](http://Wen.Markets) is a token launchpad bulletin board where anyone can create and bootstrap ERC20 token liquidity free from rugpulls, and post comments for discussion, inspired by 4chan and the Internet culture.

Wen Markets helps prevent rugpulls by standardizing the token creation process.  Anyone can create the token, upload an image, and launch.  However, they do no control the tokenomics - it's all been standardized through Wen Markets.  There's no dev to dump on you. 

Wen's liquidity migration is atomic and instant - when a token hits a MCap threshold (\~$69k), the smart contract will permissionlessly migrate the liquidity to a public AMM (quickswap), and burn it!

Tokens are launched fairly with liquidity locked forever, preventing any sneaky rug pulls.  
  
**How to Use WEN**   
Pick a token you like or create your own.  
Buy via the bonding curve with MATIC (think of this like your basic LP, as more people buy, the MC &amp; price goes ups).  
Hodl forever or sell whenever.   
  
**Token Graduation**   
When enough people buy a token, it ""graduates."" The liquidity moves to a DEX and is burned, ensuring long-term stability and value.

,t3 _ 1d6e7a8,0xPolygon,Sharing this amazing Twitter post by Plaxtico,"OurNetwork recently published a comprehensive article on Polygon, and the results are extremely bullish. 

Let’s analyze some of the key metrics that support these bullish findings.👇

𝐁𝐫𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭 𝐄𝐜𝐨𝐬𝐲𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐦 𝐅𝐮𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞: 

Strong blockchains rely on robust applications, and Polygon stands out as second only to Ethereum in terms of active weekly developers (909) and commits (5,900). 

Polygon applications provide tangible real-world value and practical utility beyond mere speculative trading.

With its impressive 1.9 million stablecoin users over the past 30 days, Polygon stands out among its peers. 

Users are leveraging the network for purposes beyond speculative DeFi activities. 

𝐕𝐢𝐛𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐭 𝐎𝐧-𝐜𝐡𝐚𝐢𝐧 𝐄𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐨𝐦𝐲:

Polygon’s Total Value Locked (TVL) stands at $987 million, with half of this attributed to Aave, the leading lending protocol on the network ($472 million TVL). 

Year-to-date, Polygon has seen $1.97 billion in bridging inflows, with 98% originating from Ethereum Mainnet, compared to $1.85 billion in outflows. 

These sustained net positive inflows serve as a robust indicator of genuine demand for services within the Polygon ecosystem.

As of May 26, 2024, Polygon PoS boasts 8.7 million monthly active wallets, 3.7 million weekly active wallets, and 1.1 million daily active wallets. 

This represents a doubling in daily active users (DAU) over the past year. Additionally, the blockchain processed 3.8 million daily transactions, marking a 35% increase compared to the previous 12 months. 

These impressive metrics position Polygon PoS as one of the leading EVM chains in terms of both active wallets and transaction volume, a throne previously held by Binance Chain.

𝐃𝐞𝐅𝐢 𝐏𝐨𝐰𝐞𝐫𝐡𝐨𝐮𝐬𝐞:

In the past year, Polygon PoS’s decentralized exchanges (DEXs) have facilitated a staggering $54.9 billion in trading volume and processed 301 million DeFi transactions. 

When compared to other Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum, Base, and Optimism during the same period, Polygon stands out as the second-largest network in terms of traders, trades, and Uniswap protocol volume.

Among the notable DeFi protocols on Polygon PoS are Azuro, which powers prediction apps, and Quickswap, a native DEX within the Polygon ecosystem.

Polygon’s Proof of Stake (PoS) network currently boasts a Total Value Locked (TVL) of $980.1 million. Nearly 90% of this TVL is held by the top ten protocols. Among them, Aave dominates with 47%, followed by Uniswap at 12%, and Quickswap with 10%.

Since the beginning of the year, Polygon’s Proof of Stake (PoS) network has experienced a 31% surge in its overall stablecoin market capitalization, climbing from $1.3 billion to $1.7 billion. 

This impressive growth is predominantly fueled by a remarkable 44% increase in USDT’s market cap, which surged from $614 million to $886 million. Meanwhile, USDC’s market cap currently stands at $512 million.

𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐄𝐕𝐌 𝐬𝐜𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐛𝐥𝐨𝐜𝐤𝐜𝐡𝐚𝐢𝐧:

Polygon offers a comprehensive suite of Ethereum scaling solutions, encompassing PoS (Proof of Stake), AggLayer, CDK (Chain Developer Kit), and zkEVM (Zero-Knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine). 

It’s no wonder that protocols and developers are eagerly embracing Polygon to construct the next widely adopted blockchain technology. 

Polygon’s strengths lie in its Layer 2 Scalability, EVM Compatibility, robust Security, Decentralization, Developer-friendly approach, and thriving open-source ecosystem.

,t3 _ 1d2qyw7,0xPolygon,Polygon is releasing the source code for the Pessimistic Proof tomorrow! Absolutely amazing accomplishment by this team!,"Blog post - [https://polygon.technology/blog/introducing-the-pessimistic-proof-for-the-agglayer-zk-security-for-cross-chain-interoperability](https://polygon.technology/blog/introducing-the-pessimistic-proof-for-the-agglayer-zk-security-for-cross-chain-interoperability)

Tweet - [https://x.com/0xPolygon/status/1795504524427165910](https://x.com/0xPolygon/status/1795504524427165910)

# Cryptographic safety for the AggLayer requires a novel solution. It’s called the pessimistic proof and it treats all chains suspiciously. Here’s how it works.

tl;dr  


* In its endstate, the AggLayer will be a decentralized protocol that scales blockchains by unifying liquidity, users, and state. It does so in part via a unified bridge
* The pessimistic proof provides the cryptographic guarantee that allows chains to connect to a shared bridge without additional trust assumptions; it ensures that, even if a chain’s security is compromised, it cannot drain funds from other chains
* A pessimistic proof does this by constantly ensuring that no chains are lying about deposits to their chain 
* Practically speaking, it will eventually allow users to move assets from Chain A to Chain B without needing to take an intermediate step via the L1
* The earliest iteration of the AggLayer will prioritize safety over speed; but, by design, the AggLayer supports interoperability that is faster than Ethereum’s finality

When a blockchain connects to the AggLayer, it joins many other chains in a single, unified bridge connected to Ethereum. This is already the case for OKX’s X Layer, Astar zkEVM, and Polygon zkEVM—with more coming soon.

A shared bridge allows users to seamlessly send and receive fungible assets between L2s, providing far better UX than third-party bridges, which result in users receiving wrapped synthetic versions of an asset on the destination chain, or multiple native bridges, which would impose delays of up to seven days (!) in the case of optimistic rollups. 

But this solution comes with a novel problem: As the AggLayer expands to support different provers and consensus mechanisms, the chance of a soundness error rises. Without a proper safety mechanism, a malicious actor on one chain could potentially exploit the entire bridge. 

**The solution is what we’re calling the pessimistic proof, a novel zero-knowledge proof ensuring cryptographic safety for cross-chain transactions.** 

We call it pessimistic because the AggLayer assumes all chains are unreliable and can’t play nice with one another. With the pessimistic proof, one chain’s issues definitionally cannot contaminate the rest of the chains on the unified bridge. 

**Taking a pessimistic view of every individual chain ensures the collective safety of all chains.** 

(\*\*Note\*\*: The AggLayer *does not* extend security guarantees to any chain. Every chain connected to the AggLayer continues to use its existing finality mechanism. What the pessimistic proof ensures is cross-chain security for the entire aggregated blockchain network: A security issue on any one chain cannot drain deposits made to any other chain on the unified bridge.) 

Let’s break down how pessimistic proofs work, both at a conceptual level, and in practice.

# Tracking the state of the unified bridge

From the AggLayer’s perspective, the unified bridge is a big network of chains—a network that grows more complicated as more chains join.

To keep this network safe, the AggLayer needs a full view of all the transfers of assets and messages across the chains in order to guarantee a crucial piece of information: **At no point can any chain withdraw more from the bridge than what has been deposited on the chain’s L1 contract**. 

The AggLayer is charged with checking three key pieces of information required to generate a pessimistic proof and make the above guarantee. These checks are:

1. Chain updates have been done correctly;
2. Chains have done their *internal* accounting correctly—meaning they didn’t try to withdraw tokens they didn’t have; and
3. All of the chains together do all of the internal accounting together, correctly.

This is the AggLayer’s way of interrogating each chain to make sure it hasn’t tried to withdraw more from the bridge than has been deposited. In this way, a chain that can’t play nice with others is only a threat to itself—but not to the rest of the aggregated network.

In other words, if Chain A says it has 100 POL deposited on the bridge, the AggLayer keeps track to make sure it does not subsequently attempt to withdraw 200 POL, whether through equivocation or an exploit by some malicious actor. 

So how does the AggLayer provide a ZK proof to the underlying L1 that guarantees no chain balance dips below zero? 

And, importantly, how can this be done in a way that minimizes complexity so as to keep cost and latency low?

# Leafs, exit roots, and Merkle trees

Here’s how the pessimistic proof ensures safety: Each chain connected to the AggLayer maintains a **local exit tree**, which tracks all withdrawals from that chain. 

Using the root of each chain’s local exit tree, the AggLayer can build a global view of all withdrawals from all chains on the unified bridge; this is called the “**global exit tree**.”

In short, the AggLayer tracks two numbers, withdrawals and deposits, so that it can get a view of the current balance across all chains. 

Because the global exit tree is committed to the L1, the AggLayer must know that all local exit trees are valid, too, to ensure that the *next* global exit tree is also valid. 

In other words, the AggLayer needs to know that the cumulative state of all connected chains checks out. 

To ensure this cryptographically, the AggLayer generates a pessimistic proof, which requires three inputs from each chain: 

1. The chain’s local exit tree, as of its most recent update
2. The list of new withdrawals included in the current update
3. The chain’s expected new local exit root

Using inputs 1 and 2, the AggLayer computes the new local exit root, compares it with the chain’s expected local exit root, and generates a proof that answers the question: Did the local exit root update properly? 

Before committing a new global exit root to the L1, the AggLayer must also make sure that no chain is withdrawing more tokens than have been deposited to it. This is its way of interrogating each chain to make sure no chain is lying and trying to rug the unified bridge.

Using the pessimistic proof, the AggLayer is able to compute how many tokens of each type were withdrawn from each chain. These values are then summed across all chains, leaving a single view of the total balances available for each token on the AggLayer.

If any chain is found to have a negative balance, the AggLayer determines that the chain has attempted to withdraw tokens that were not deposited into it. Not good.

In that case, the chain’s update is *invalid*, and any pessimistic proof containing that chain’s invalid state cannot be verified on the L1. This prevents the offending chain’s update from settling to Ethereum—keeping the aggregated network safe.

So to sum up: The AggLayer scrutinizes all chain balances on the unified bridge and generates a cryptographic guarantee that no bad actors are draining the bridge. In the end, a prover generates a single, final pessimistic proof. 

This is the AggLayer’s way of temporarily suspending pessimism. All chain updates were done correctly, and none of these updates resulted in negative balances for the unified bridge. OK, good to go. 

By isolating bad actors, the AggLayer cryptographically guarantees the safety of funds flowing across the entire network.

There is more coming on the pessimistic proof tomorrow. Stay tuned. ",0.92,33,0,33,Polygon,2024-05-28 18:44:25

,t3 _ 1d23uzd,0xPolygon,Polygon Rewind: Accomplishments and Vibe Check after a Year of Building,"# Polygon is in a new era. Get in, we’re going to the past!

tl;dr

* “Polygon” is more than Polygon Proof-of-Stake—it’s an aggregated blockchain network, and since the Polygon 2.0 roadmap was launched nearly a year ago, as a series of community proposals, there have been a lot of developments
* The first components of the AggLayer went live in February 2024, with three chains connecting: X Layer, Astar zkEVM, and Polygon zkEVM
* A number of chains began to build with Polygon CDK (Chain Development Kit), an open source collection of software components that makes it easy to build and launch custom-designed zero-knowledge blockchains
* After reaching community consensus, the contracts for POL went live on mainnet
* Governance proposals reached community consensus, including a framework for community-driven funding of the Community Treasury, and an independent Community Treasury Board

Time for a vibe check: A series of community proposals set forth as Polygon 2.0 during the hot summer of 2023, reimagined nearly every aspect of Polygon networks—and laid the groundwork for an aggregated blockchain network. Developers and key community members have spent the last year building.

So, what’s been accomplished in that time? 

Actually, a lot; enough to lose track of. It’s worth taking a stroll down memory lane. 

* It’s been a huge year for a community of builders and enthusiastic advocates. 
* Developers from across the broader Polygon community, including Polygon Labs, have broken fresh technological ground and reoriented, with community consensus, the direction of Polygon.

If you’re not in the know, or want to re/defamiliarize with how Polygon is evolving, take a peak at this recent post that sums it all up: 

* [WTF Is Polygon?](https://polygon.technology/blog/wtf-is-polygon) 

Psst: Polygon is more than Polygon PoS—it’s becoming an aggregated blockchain network where a web of sovereign chains feels like a single one. The last twelve months have been the first steps to get there. 

Let’s see what’s been done.

# Building the AggLayer



The Aggrgation Layer, or AggLayer, is the first aggregated blockchain network, **and the first components** [**went live in February 2024**](https://polygon.technology/blog/aggregated-blockchains-a-new-thesis)**.** 

Arguably, this is one of the biggest accomplishments of the last year, so let’s slow down to understand what it is and what it means for users, developers, and Polygon.

The AggLayer is a credibly neutral service that will accept proofs from connected chains; verify that chain states are consistent; aggregate these proofs; and settle to Ethereum. The barrier to entry will be low. Three chains have already connected:

1. [X Layer](https://polygon.technology/blog/okx-launches-x-layer-built-with-polygon-cdk-enabling-50m-users-to-tap-unified-liquidy-of-the-agglayer), a ZK chain built using Polygon CDK (Chain Development Kit) by the centralized exchange, OKX. It will give a decentralized route for millions of OKX users to seamlessly experience cross-chain network effects and a massive ecosystem
2. [Astar zkEVM](https://polygon.technology/blog/astar-zkevm-built-with-polygon-cdk-connects-to-agglayer-and-taps-unified-liquidity-with-polygon-zkevm), a general purpose ZK chain built by Japan’s Web3 leader
3. Polygon zkEVM, a full-featured, EVM-equivalent rollup

So, what is the AggLayer? An aggregated approach is the synthesis of the monolithic versus modular dialectic that’s been at the center of the blockchain scaling debate.

In short, an aggregated approach combines the best of both worlds: a modular, multichain ecosystem that settles on Ethereum. The AggLayer enables access to shared state and liquidity across connected chains, providing users with a single-chain experience even as they navigate between different chains and execution environments.

The AggLayer will make this thesis a reality. It achieves three critical objectives:

1. Asset fungibility: A unified bridge ensures that L1 assets can be safely locked and used across different chains. Eliminates the need for cumbersome withdrawals and bridging services.
2. Trustless: Users are not required to make any additional trust assumptions. In the context of cross-chain interoperability, this means security that is at least as strong as the underlying domains.
3. Low-latency transaction and messaging: The AggLayer enables chains to coordinate and operate at lower-than-Ethereum latency. Fast transactions between chains.

These capabilities give rise to shared liquidity.

As the AggLayer continues to evolve, it will unlock new possibilities for developers and users, enabling a new era of interoperability and innovation in the multichain ecosystem.

# Proposal to move Polygon PoS to ZK – and connect to the AggLayer

Polygon PoS has been cooking. With more daily active users and better UX than ever, the chain has quietly become a technical behemoth and a real example of sustained adoption in the crypto landscape. Highlights over the last 12 months: 

1. Quietly launched [parallelized EVM](https://twitter.com/sandeepnailwal/status/1742160301024264224?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) last summer
2. Three major upgrades in [Inborg](https://polygon.technology/blog/inborg-upgrade-for-the-polygon-pos-network-state-sync-with-indore), [Aalborg](https://polygon.technology/blog/faster-finality-with-the-aalborg-upgrade-for-polygon-proof-of-stake-network), and [Napoli](https://polygon.technology/blog/polygon-pos-is-cooking-the-napoli-upgrade-means-better-ux-the-mumbai-testnet-takes-a-bow?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=pos-is-cooking):some text
   1. Reduced deep reorgs
   2. Increased finality
   3. Introduced adoption for RIP-7212, the first rollup improvement proposal, for better account abstraction
   4. Plus a bunch of other improvements and support for precompiles 

Even while the community reached consensus to achieve all of these upgrades—last June, a [technical proposal](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pre-pip-discussion-upgrading-polygon-pos-to-a-zkevm-validium/12187) laid out the case to **migrate the current Polygon PoS architecture to a zkEVM validium**. Doing so would make Polygon PoS a true L2.

* [Discussion is ongoing](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pre-pip-discussion-upgrading-polygon-pos-to-a-zkevm-validium/12187/27). A core part of the Polygon 2.0 vision is uniting a fragmented crypto landscape, enabling shared liquidity and state across sovereign chains—which includes connecting the behemoth, Polygon PoS, to the AggLayer, too.
* **Other solutions for connecting PoS to the AggLayer in the near-term remain an area of active investigation**.  

# Polygon CDK, for sovereignty and horizontal scale 

There have been so many announcements in the last year about Polygon CDK (Chain Development Kit) that it can be hard to keep track of who is building what. First, a brief reminder: [Polygon CDK](https://polygon.technology/polygon-cdk) makes it easy for developers to design and launch chains on Ethereum, or migrate existing chains. Chain design is made seamlessly modular and sovereign, with developers enjoying freedom to tailor a chain's architecture to specific needs. By offering a set of supported, open-source components, Polygon CDK enables developers to create custom blockchain solutions that cater to their unique requirements.

As a stack, Polygon CDK is undergoing research upgrades, such as:

* A next generation of ZK proving technology, including [a Type 1 ZKEVM prover](https://polygon.technology/blog/upgrade-every-evm-chain-to-zk-introducing-the-type-1-prover) built [in collaboration with Toposware](https://toposware.medium.com/beyond-limits-pushing-the-boundaries-of-zk-evm-9dd0c5ec9fca)

# POL, live on mainnet

The formal specifications of a multiphase upgrade to Polygon were outlined in a Polygon Improvement Proposal, [PIP-18](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pip-18-polygon-2-0-phase-0-frontier/12913), in September 2023 on the community forum—and after reaching community consensus, the [contracts for POL are live on mainnet](https://polygon.technology/blog/polygon-2-0-milestone-pol-contracts-are-live-on-ethereum-mainnet). 

In Phase 0, it was proposed that Polygon PoS and Polygon zkEVM would not change anything for end users. 

The proposal covered multiple changes to be implemented in the system smart contracts of these chains on Ethereum, the core of which are:

1. The initiation of the POL upgrade
2. The upgrade from MATIC to POL as the native (gas) token for Polygon PoS
3. The adoption of POL as the staking token for Polygon PoS
4. The launch of the Staking Layer and migration of Polygon public chains to consequently leverage it

By October, after community consensus, POL went live on mainnet. A quick roundup:

* As a next-generation token, POL will help power the diverse, growing number of chains in the Aggregation Layer (AggLayer) via a native re-staking protocol.
* Staking Hub allows POL holders to validate multiple chains and perform multiple roles on each of those chains (sequencing, ZK proof generation, participation in data availability committees, etc.). 

Next on the roadmap? Initiating the migration of MATIC to POL as the native gas token for Polygon PoS and migrating the staking token for PoS from MATIC to [POL.Read](http://POL.Read) more, here: [Polygon 2.0 Milestone: POL Contracts Are Live on Ethereum Mainnet](https://polygon.technology/blog/polygon-2-0-milestone-pol-contracts-are-live-on-ethereum-mainnet)

# [‍](https://polygon.technology/blog/polygon-2-0-milestone-pol-contracts-are-live-on-ethereum-mainnet)Governance, Ecosystem Council, and the Community Treasury Board 

A [new governance system](https://polygon.technology/blog/polygon-2-0-governance) was proposed to reflect the evolving nature of Polygon technology and protocols. This model, which for protocol governance draws heavily from Ethereum’s, was meant to ensure decentralized decision-making, allowing the community to actively participate in the governance process. 

The system is built on three pillars: Protocol Governance, System Smart Contracts Governance, and Community Treasury Governance. 

Each of these pillars plays a vital role in maintaining the network's integrity and growth, transparency, and effectiveness. This governance framework is a testament to Polygon's commitment to a community-driven approach in the growth and evolution of its ecosystem.

So what was actually accomplished?

* The [Polygon Protocol Council](https://polygon.technology/blog/meet-the-polygon-protocol-council), approved by the community in a Polygon Improvement Proposal ([PIP-29](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pip-29-polygon-protocol-council/13075)), is a community-governed body of 13 members responsible for narrow-in-scope changes to system smart contracts implemented on Ethereum for existing and future Polygon protocols.
* A framework for community-driven funding, as laid out in the Polygon Funding Proposal framework ([PFP-1](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pfp-1-polygon-funding-proposal-framework/13759)), has reached community consensus, with the first season of grants just around the corner.
* The [Community Treasury Board](https://polygon.technology/blog/introducing-the-polygon-community-treasury-board-and-a-proposed-framework-for-community-treasury-governance) and Governance Framework, as proposed in PFP-2, would establish a decentralized, community-first approach to distributing grants to Polygon-based projects

The future of Polygon relies on community input, feedback, and approval. Join the conversation by tuning into the Polygon Protocol Governance Calls, on [the Polygon Foundation handle](https://twitter.com/0xPolygonFdn/status/1775901225692934438), or heading to the forum.

# Aggregating it all together: The road ahead

Polygon is all in on aggregation. 

* With the AggLayer, new and existing chains 
* With Polygon CDK, any project can seamlessly launch a ZK-powered chain, or migrate existing ones–with all of the liquidity, users, and state–into the AggLayer. 

For Polygon Labs, this is the path ahead: Contributing to an aggregated web of sovereign chains.

2024 is year zero for Polygon as the aggregated blockchains network that looks, feels, and scales like the Internet. The tools to achieve this are already here: the AggLayer, Polygon CDK, and robust ZK technology.

,t3 _ 1czk6v7,0xPolygon,L3s v. Aggregated L2s: An Analysis for Developers,"L3s may have some benefits, but also many drawbacks. L2s have identical benefits without those drawbacks when connected to the AggLayer.

tl;dr

* L3s have been proposed as a fix for crypto scaling, but they come with many downsides 
* Aggregated L2s have all the benefits, but not the downsides, with true scale for crypto
* Some L3s may experience interoperability within a single L2 ecosystem, but this still fragments liquidity and users by creating moats
* Fee extraction is baked into many L3 models, which rely on L2 for settlement
* L3s sacrifice some sovereignty, relying on governance and fee extraction as imposed by the L2s

Developers have never had more choices than they have now. How to build, where to build, what to build: There are tons of options for crypto devs to embrace sovereignty across any number of technologies. 

But true sovereignty depends on a tech stack that encodes that idea. 

When Layer 3 blockchains (L3s) are proposed as a solution in the crypto scaling debate, it is often with false dichotomies. Proponents claim L3s have a number of benefits over Layer 2s (L2s) that should permanently put them on the crypto scaling roadmap.

Polygon Labs doesn’t think this is a good idea. In fact, along with other major thinkers in the space, we worry that L3s are dressed up as architectural necessities when in fact they risk locking in ecosystem-specific network effects for whatever L2 by creating demand for that network’s blockspace at the expense of sovereignty, the will of an L2s governance, inefficient bridging, and the broader health of Ethereum.  

Far from fixing fragmentation or encouraging horizontal growth, L3s create clusters of state and liquidity native to specific L2 ecosystems—exactly reproducing the current challenges of fragmentation in crypto scaling, rather than fixing them. 

In fact, there are compelling arguments for why this is strictly good for specific L2s (not the L3s built on them), but probably not good for Ethereum. Far from driving network effects to Ethereum and encouraging unified liquidity and state, L3s turn respective L2s into the settlement layer. Value accrues to L2, but isn’t passed onto Ethereum. 

This post will break apart the myths of L3s by showing how aggregated L2s are a positive sum game. 

Strictly speaking, with the AggLayer, L1s, L2s, L3s, and L(N)s can interoperate in a multichain universe, with amortized fees and low latency, leveraging Ethereum as a settlement layer. 

An aggregated, horizontally scalable network creates the conditions for shared liquidity and state, unifying rather than continuing to fracture crypto computation. 

All this while also allowing developers and users to maintain sovereignty and avoid fee extraction.

This post breaks down the supposed benefits of L3s, and shows these are achievable when chains connect to the AggLayer.

#Mythbusting L3 benefits

Plenty has been written and spoken about the supposed benefits of building and deploying an L3. Usually, these arguments are made by core developers of L2 projects, who have entrenched reasons to advocate for L3s.

We’ll walk through some major myths and break them apart. It turns out that the AggLayer, as a neutral public good for aggregated blockchain networks, endows the very same benefits (minus the drawbacks) for connected chains as those claimed to be unique for L3s.

Myth: L3s are customizable to a degree that’s not possible with L2s

Reality: L2s are customizable in any way a builder wants. L3s are proposed as a solution for endless customization, but the reality is that locking into an L2 ecosystem curtails sovereignty and therefore ultimate customization. L3s are subject to the L2s on which they’re built, while L2s can be customized without those risks. 

And while chain development tools like OP Stack or Arbitrum Orbit offer appchains customization, there are also imposed requirements on sovereignty—different predefined governance frameworks or lock-ins to consensus mechanisms—or fee extraction.

Polygon CDK, on the other hand, allows for maximum choice and customization, without external demands or lock in. 

That’s sovereignty.

Developers interested in building L3s can use Polygon CDK instead to spin up ZK-powered chains on-demand. Build custom chains with added mods and variations, from gas tokens to regulatory design concerns to sequencer type to data availability—and much more—all without extractive fees. 

In fact, to build with Polygon CDK is to experience more customizability than the vision for L3s. Polygon CDK chains—or, really, any chain—can opt for fast interoperability and connect to the AggLayer, which means access to shared state and liquidity. As more chains connect to the AggLayer, all other chains benefit from shared liquidity and users.

Myth: L3s are the best way to amortize transaction costs because data is posted to an L2 and not to Ethereum

Reality: L2s can amortize costs through proof aggregation. L3s are posited as a way to amortize the cost of transactions because the expense of posting to Ethereum is replaced instead by posting to some arbitrary L2, which then will ferry transaction data to Ethereum. The idea is that if the L2 is the base layer, then transaction fees on L3 will be that much lower. 

In reality, this architecture means chains must sacrifice sovereignty, possibly pay extractive fees, and concentrate power in one L2 ecosystem.  

With zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs, an aggregated network can take a bunch of chain states, bundle them into a single proof, and post that to Ethereum. The unique trait that makes this possible is called recursion—which means one proof can be generated that is composed of many other proofs. A bunch of proofs are bundled together and unified into one—amortizing the cost not just of transactions, but (potentially) thousands of chain states. 

This is, in fact, a benefit native only to ZK tech. 

It might be the case that in an optimistic framework, L3s really do amortize transaction cost. But that’s because there’s no way to recursively aggregate fraud proofs—let alone recursively aggregate chain states. The L2 becomes the aggregate of chain states.

With the AggLayer, ZK tech significantly reduces the cost of posting to L1 by using recursion to amortize the fee across what can be thousands of chains—and without imposing on sovereignty.

All of the above is part of a larger myth: That an optimistic framework will somehow always be cheaper than ZK architecture. Not only is this untrue, but it will be increasingly less true as the technology improves and more chains connect to the AggLayer.

Myth: L3s are better for multichain interoperability

Reality: L2s are better for multichain interop. The L2/L3 model comes with a number of security and economic considerations that make it strictly worse for multichain interop. The L2 operators on which an L3 is settled may control translation order, inclusion on L2, and when L3s are settled on blocks. Even with decentralized sequencers, sequencers will behave in an economically rational way, which may mean censoring L3 settlement in order to extract MEV on L2, charging rent, and so on.

In other words, interop gained but at the cost of extracting value from users and developers of an L3 chain by the L2 on which it is settled.

An aggregated framework is superior for multichain interoperability, and the reason comes down to two important elements: sovereignty and maximum extractable value (MEV). 

An aggregated network provides a secure, low-latency way for any chain, whether L1 or L(n), to send transactions across one or many chains. Crucially, the AggLayer is not involved with ordering or including transactions at all—only the pre-sequenced blocks from chains.

So the incentives are different on the AggLayer. There are no assets natively on the AggLayer, nothing to be gained by changing ordering, and a material difference for AggLayer validators compared to sequencers operating on an L2 with an L3 ecosystem. 

The case is harder to figure out how AggLayer validators would extract MEV. 

In aggregate, this means the AggLayer avoids possible censorship and MEV extraction, while at the same time not imposing conditions on chains that connect. Aggregated L2s experience fast interoperability and complete sovereignty, with amortized cost—every benefit, and more, of the case for L3s.

Myth: Onboarding to an L3 is easier than L2s and avoids expensive bridging

Reality: L2s are as easy to onboard to or easier than L3s. L3s have a dependency—they rely on an L2 chain to connect to as many onramps as possible. Aggregated chains have no comparable chokepoint. 

The argument for this myth seems to be that because L2s pushing the L3 narrative have centralized exchange (CEX) connections, a newly spun up L3 blockchain can easily onboard more users by going CEX → L2 → L3. New blockchains that haven’t yet found a CEX connection can just leverage existing ones for the L2.

In reality, aggregated L2s invert the requirements and have more inclusive onboarding: Instead of relying on a single L2 to connect with as many CEX’s as possible, which is the L3 case, in an aggregated network, what matters is the aggregate number of onramps across all chains. 

Suppose a new chain, let’s call it Superdank, connects to the AggLayer. Superdank doesn’t need a CEX connection because it can leverage the CEX connections of any number of chains, like X Layer or (anticipated in the future) Polygon PoS or many more. So users of Superdank would go CEX → any connected chain → Superdank.

Superdank automatically enjoys not just unified liquidity, but also an entire aggregated user base across the network. 

Instead of having to rely on the maximum number of exchanges connected to a single L2 chain, users that want to onboard to Superdank can interact from any connected L2.

And while proponents point to small, negligible fees for bridging from L2 to L3, the same is true of cross-chain transactions in the AggLayer— fees are inexpensive with low-latency. 

No chokepoints, lots of choice.

#L3 Downsides

Time to sum up the above explicitly: L3s have more downsides than aggregated L2s. Let’s look at what these are: 

* Building an L3 in a fragmented moat won’t scale any project. L3s may create interop within a single L2 ecosystem, but they face the same scaling dilemma that has traditionally plagued crypto: Fragmented liquidity and users. Aggregated chains and L2s, on the other hand, share state and liquidity. Building behind a walled garden, no matter how currently popular, won’t ever reach the interoperability heights required for a true internet-sized crypto landscape.
*Some L3s have to pay the L2, while aggregated L2s don’t. This isn’t universal, but it’s important to note: Fee extraction or rent by an L2 on an L3 is part of many L3/L2 models. It’s not equivalent for L2s in an aggregated context, which doesn’t require payment or extract rent.  
*L3s rely on L2s for security—not L1s. There is a chokepoint at the heart of the L3 design: Relying on an L2 for security guarantees. The truth is that right now, L2s do not have the economic or decentralized security to serve as a settlement layer. Although more layers may decrease fees, it also includes more chances for things to go wrong—enormous block reorgs are still complex at an L3 level.‍
*Built-in lack of sovereignty and governance control. L3s rely on the governance and execution environments provided by the L2s. Any kind of sovereignty or governance for the L3 in itself will always be subject to the L2.

#So why is L3 a thing? 

It comes down to demand for blockspace and lack of ZK technology. L2s building outside of the ZK space need a means of interoperating that takes shortcuts. It makes business sense to increase demand for blockspace and lock in the network effects of L3s. 

But doing this is a zero sum game, and may be detrimental to Ethereum while certainly limiting L3s. L2/L3 relationships benefit only the local L2, rather than increasing the net capacity and liquidity across crypto.

A core problem might be that L2s interested in L3s are not building with the ZK tech that can truly create secure interoperability in an aggregated network. So to make up for it, a new architecture was designed that would justify network effects and demand.

This not only recreates the current conditions of crypto, but could hypothetically serve as a challenge to Ethereum: When an L2 believes it can create sufficient network effects to spin up their own validator set with sufficient economic security.

As such, all the above are reasons to be vigilant about biased design choices and think through the win-win design of neutral aggregated networks like the AggLayer.

,t3 _ 1cwp207,0xPolygon,Upcoming Stablecoin DEX looking for Polygon Beta Testers,"Hi /r/0xPolygon :)

I'm working on a project with a new upcoming Stablecoin DEX called Stabull, and we're just finishing internal testing at the moment. We're looking to get about two dozen beta testers to test the Polygon version of the platform. It's about an hour's work, it's paid (some matic/usdc for testing swaps and liquidity, and then some more USDC on completion of the tests). 

Currently we're looking at getting a range of people with different devices and browsers. While it's set up mainly using Metamask, we're also testing other configurations, and have already tested with Brave Wallet, Metamask hooked up to Trezor, and Rabby with a ledger nano. 

  
If you're interested, info and registration is over at [https://stabull.finance/help-beta-test-stabull/](https://stabull.finance/help-beta-test-stabull/) and it's only going to be ongoing for a week or so from today (20th May).

  
Thanks!",0.88,6,0,6,Polygon,2024-05-20 20:08:19
